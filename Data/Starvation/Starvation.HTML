<p> Data > Starvation

<p>
When starvation is self-imposed, it is called <i>prolonged fasting</i>
or sometimes a <i>hunger strike</i>. When it is not self-imposed, it
is called <i>starvation</i>.

<p>
There is an obscure, expensive and very informative monograph titled

<p class='Indent'>
McCue, Marshall D. (Editor). Comparative Physiology of Fasting,
Starvation and Food Limitation. Springer 2012.

<p>
containing info on the physiology of human starvation. Particularly
relevant are chapters 22 and 21.

of Energy Expenditure, Macronutrient Metabolism and Body Composition
(Chapter 22).

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Prolonged Fasting (Non-Caloric Supplements)

<p>
When prolonged fasting is undertaken to produce weight loss, non-caloric
supplements are allowed. These supplements typically consist of water,
electrolytes and vitamins.

<p>
The principal energy sources during fasting are the body's fat stores
and the body's proteins. Thus the length of time that fasting can continue
(before mortal events occur) is highly dependent on the body's initial fat
mass.

<p>
The record duration for fasting is probably 382 days (Stewart and Fleming).
The man began as obese (207 kG or 456 Lbs) and lost 125 kG or 275 Lbs.
This is an average daily weight loss of 0.72 Lbs/Day.

<p>
Blood glucose levels were in the 20 to 40 mG/dL range.

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Prolonged Fasting (Water Only)

<p>
David Blaine (varously called a performance artist and a majician) completed
a 44 day water-only self-imposed fast -- hanging in a plastic box over the
River Thames, I think (Jackson, et.al, Korbonits et.al.).

<p>
Obese fasters have a lot of adipose tissue and they metabolize a lot of
adipose tissue. This subject didn't have a lot of adipose tissue and
instead metabolized protein, mainly from skeletal muscle.

<p>
Hall (Chapter 22) has data from Benedict showing BMR decreasing with
fasting from ~1550 kCal/Day to ~1050 at day 30.

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Electrolyte Excretion

<p>
Since there is no electrolyte intake in a water-only fast, electrolyte
balance becomes electrolyte excretion.

<p>
In the study described above, final serum sodium concentration was normal
(140 mEq/L) and a mild hypokalemia was observed (3.3 mEq/L).

<p>
Large volumes of urine were produced (~3 L/Day) containing low concentrations
of sodium (~10 mEq/L).

<p>
In the fast-food culture, salt (NaCl, M.W. = 58.44) intake might typically
be 250 mMol/Day (14.6 G/Day). In contrast, the Yanomamo Indians are healthy
with a lifetime salt intake of less than 1 mMol/Day (Oliver et.al.). Thus,
the kidney is perfectly capable of preserving sodium balance with very low
sodium intake.

<p>
Again, referring to the study above.

<table class='Table'>

<tr><td> </td><td> Start </td><td> End </td><td> Change </td></tr>
<tr><td> Body Sodium (G) </td><td> 136 </td><td> 118.6 </td><td> 17.4 (-12.8%) </td></tr>
<tr><td> Body Potassium (G) </td><td> 190 </td><td> 136.3 </td><td> 53.7 (-28.1%) </td></tr>

</table>

<p>
Reference Man (Snyder et.al.) indicates that a 70 kG body contains 100 G
of sodium. The approximate compartments are tabulated below.

<table class='Table'>

<tr><td> </td><td> G </td><td> mEq </td></tr>
<tr><td> Extracellular Fluid </td><td> 48 </td><td> 2100 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Cytoplasm </td><td> 7 </td><td> 300 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Other </td><td> 45 </td><td> 1950 </td></tr>
<tr><td> Total </td><td> 100 </td><td> 4350 </td></tr>

</table>

<p>
Other is probably sodium in structural elements.
