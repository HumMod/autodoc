<p> Data > CO2 Transport

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Units

<p>
Total blood CO2 content is reported as mL (of STP gas) / mL (of blood)
and also as mMol/L. In this analysis, we'll deviate slighly and use
mMol/mL in the mathematics.

<p>
A mMol of gas occupies a standard volume of 22.4 mL.  Multiply mL/mL
by 44.6 to get mMol/L. Multiply by 0.0446 to get mMol/mL.

<p>
Square brackets [ ] indicated concentration.

<p>
SID means <i>strong ion difference</i>.

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Overview

<p>
CO2 in the blood is mainly (88%) transported as bicarbonate [HCO3].
The remaining 12% is bound to proteins or in solution. As a first
approximation, we'll consider bicarbonate transport only.

<p>
The concentration of HCO3 in the blood is a function of the partial
pressure of CO2 (pCO2) as quantitated by CO2's disassociation curve.
But [HCO3] is also a function of [SID].

<p>
To get an acceptable physiological representation, we must model both
of these factors.

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> CO2 Dissociation Curve.

<p>
This relationship was accurately described a century ago.

<p><img class="Indent2X" src="Figure-1.png">

<p>
This relationship might adequately be modeled using pCO2/(p50 + pCO2).
Note that the function must be invertible and this one is.

<p>
Looking at the figure, I estimate that the p50 for HCO3 as a function
of PCO2 is 32 mmHg.

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Strong Ion Difference

<p>
Just as important as pCO2 is [SID], which modulates the pCO2 to
[HCO3] equilibrium constant. A decreasing [SID] (acidosis) decreases
[HCO3] for a given pCO2. This data comes from another early study.

<p><img class="Indent2X" src="Figure-2.png">

<p>
The following model may be adequate.

<p class="Indent">
[HCO3] = K * (pCO2/(p50 + pCO2))
<br>
K = k' * [SID]
<br>
p50 = 32

<p>
where K is a linear function of [SID]. We can now fit k' to a typical
data set.

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Normal Values

<p>
Normal values for venous blood.

<p class="Indent">
pCO2 = 45 mmHg
<br>
[HCO3] = 0.0255 mMol/mL
<br>
[SID] = 0.040 mMol/mL

<p>
I popped these values into a spread sheet to get

<p class="Indent">
k' = 1.09

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Arterial Values

<p>
Normal values for arterial blood.

<p class="Indent">
pCO2 = 40 mmHg
<br>
[HCO3] = 0.0239 mMol/mL
<br>
[SID] = 0.040 mMol/mL

<p>
For these values of pCO2 and [SID], the model predicts

<p class="Indent">
[HCO3] = 0.0242

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Exercise Values

<p>
[SID] and pCO2 are altered by exercise and both have
a significant effect on [HCO3]. Venous and arterial
values are altered in their own special ways.

<p>
Increased pCO2 tends to increase [HCO3] while decreased [SID] tends to
decrease it.

<p><img class="Indent2X" src="Figure-3.png">

<p>
On the venous side, the pCO2 and [SID] effects are roughly
offsetting. On the arterial side, the [SID] effect lowers
[HCO3] while the arterial pCO2 is close to normal.

<p>
On the venous side, pCO2 increases significantly. On the arterial
side, ventilation takes care of the CO2 and the arterial values are
close to normal.

<p><img class="Indent2X" src="Figure-4.png">

<p>
[SID] decreases during exercise mainly due to lactic acid accumulation,
which is proportional to the severity of the exercise.

<p><img class="Indent2X" src="Figure-5.png">

<p>
Using this data, my best estimate for values at 200W is shown below.

<p class="Indent">
pCO2 = 70 mmHg
<br>
[HCO3] = 0.0245 mMol/mL
<br>
[SID] = 0.026 mMol/mL

<p>
For these values of pCO2 and [SID], the model predicts

<p class="Indent">
[HCO3] = 0.0195

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Inverting The Model

<p class="Indent">
  [HCO3] = K * (pCO2/(p50 + pCO2))
<br>
  K = k' * [SID]
<br>
  p50 = 32

<p>
Forward expression inverts to

<p class="Indent">
  pCO2 = (p50 * [HCO3]) / (K - [HCO3])
<br>
  K = k' * [SID]
<br>
  p50 = 32

<p>
Valid for [HCO3] >= 0 and [HCO3] < k' * [SID]

<p>
For [HCO3] < 0 use pCO2 = 0
<br>
For [HCO3] >= k' * [SID] use pCO2 = PCO2_LARGE or 1000

<p><img src="../../Bullet.PNG"> Using The Model In Tissue

<p>
Tissue is qualitatively the same as blood but
quantitatively different due to different SID's
and intrinsic [HCO3]. The two cases are tissue in
general and skeletal muscle.
