<p>
2012-08-13 HumMod version is still at v2.0.30
but I haven't pushed it yet. Doing a major rewrite
of the basic circulatory physiology and applied
math. More on this later.

<p>
2012-08-10 ModelSolver version bumped to v1.0.13
with some major internal revisions. Revisions are
not visible externally.

<p>
Class deletes : IPC_In_RestartSilent, S_RestartSilent.
RestartManager cleaned up.

<p>
2012-08-10 InteractiveController version bumped to
v1.0.13 with some major internal revisions. Revisions
are not visible externally.

<p>
Class deletes : IPC_Out_RestartSilent.

<p>
2012-08-09 InteractiveController bumped to
version v1.1.13. The numerical cells in tables
were not formatting. Fixed.

<p>
2012-08-09 ScriptedController bumped to version
v2.0.7. The controller gets some new elements.

<p>
skipaheadonerror - activates the skipping service.
Will skip script elements on a runtime error until
a skiptohereon error element is encountered.

<br>
skiptohereonerror - this is the marker mentioned
above.

<br>
displayruntimeerrors - the default response to a
runtime error is now to log the error details but
to not display them. Use this element to request
a display.

<p>
2012-08-09 HumModXML bumped to version 2.0.30.

<p>
Cleaned up dosing for thiazide, digoxin and
midodrine. This was done partly to make sure
that the timer variables were working correctly.

<p>
2012-08-08 ModelSolver bumped to version 1.0.12.
NormalDist variable now returns a value from a
population with the correct mean and standard
deviation.

<p>
Fixed an error in the REM binary operator (this
is the modulus operator).

<p>
Completed timer variables. Daily planner, etc.
are now working.

<p>
2012-08-08 InteractiveController version bumped
to v1.1.12. Fixed the time tool to correctly
show seconds in the panel element showclock.

<p>
2012-08-08 ScriptedController version bumped to
v2.0.8. Had a problem with variable roster and
storage when running two scripts back-to-back.
Fixed.

<p>
ScriptedController now automatically asks for a
reset after the model solver has been launched
and the model has been parsed. No need (typically)
to put a reset in your scripts. But, if you do,
the extra reset won't hurt anything.

<p>
2012-08-07 Attempting to standardize all of the save
and load IC's and solutions schema, beginning with
InteractiveController and ScriptedController.
InteractiveController version has been bumped to
v1.1.11 while ScriptedController version has been
bumped to v2.0.5.

<p>
2012-08-07 HumModXML version bumped to 2.0.29.

<p>
In the Win32 environment (HumMod.EXE), radiobuttons
must be grouped by the coder. I used the maplist
element that defines the radiobutton labels to also
define the members of the group. Lifestyle | Daily
Planner | Schedule is a panel filled with radiobuttons,
but each button knows what group it is in.

<p>
In .Net framework, all radiobuttons in a panel are
automatically grouped into a single group. Therefore,
in HumMod 2.0.28 and earlier, all of the radiobuttons
in the Schedule panel have automatically be made
members of the same group. So I gave each hour its
own group box (which is inherited from panel). It
fixes the problem and looks cool -- but is pretty
ugly in EXE.

<p>
The solver sends the controller two type of communications:
pages and messages. Pages go out at the end of a successful
integration interval, so we don't get communications 
related to failed steps. Messages go out immediately. But,
up to 1.1.10, the interactive controller did not display
the incoming message. Fixed and bumped version to 1.1.10.

<p>
2012-08-06 HumModXML version bumped to 2.0.28. Kidney
now has cortical (outer and inner) and medullary (outer
and inner) zones for mass, blood flow and sodium
reabsorption. The idea that is developing is that
EPO secretion comes predominantly from cells in the
interstitium of the proximal tubule. Thus, we need
some zone data to implement EPO dynamics. Zone XML
is located at Structure\Kidney\Kidney-Zones and zones
are visible at Organs | Kidneys | Organ | Zones.

<p>
Kidney runs metabolism off of venous pO2 now,
rather than tubular pO2. Has a new panel in Metabolism.
Visible at Organs | Kidney | Organ | Metabolism.

<p>
Merged Kidney-O2 into Kidney-Metabolism. Metabolism
panel gets a more detailed O2 view. Visible at Organs |
Kidney | Organ | Metabolism.

<p>
2012-08-04 HumModXML version bumped to 2.0.27. Kidney
get a panel tree modification because the nephron stuff
was buried too deep. Brought it up one level. Visible
at Organs | Kidney | Organ or Nephrons.

<p>
HumModXML. Kidney gets a new panel showing details of
kidney O2 physiology. Visible at Organs | Kidney.

<p>
HumModXML cleaned up the calculation and display of
EPO secretion. The XML is at Structure \ EPO \
EPOSecretion. The display is at Hormones | EPO - the
secretion box.

<p>
2012-08-04 ModelSolver version bumped to v1.0.11
after the random number generator was repaired.

<p>
The normal distribution mean has a positive bias
-- because I was summing 7 samples and dividing
by 6 to get the mean. Code is in Var_NormalDistribution.
ModelSolver\Docs\Code\Model Solver Notes - Random
Numbers has documentation and screen grabs.

<p>
2012-08-04 InteractiveController bumped to
v1.1.9 after a repair. Controller will ask
the solver for variable, integral, implicit
and curve rosters. When Advanced is click, it
makes a dialog tab for each of these rosters.
In the Strucutes list box, it selects the first
structure. But a model with no entries in one
of the four roster listed above has no first
structure to select and the controller was
throwing an exception. Now it selects the first
structure only when there is a first strucute
to select.

<p>
2012-08-04 ModelSolver version bumped to v1.0.10
after solver got two repairs.

<p>
Variable WhiteNoise had no default values
for lower and upper limits. Now default lower
limit is 0 and default upper limit is 1.

<p>
Variable NormalDist had no default values 
for mean and standard deviation. Now default
mean is 0 and default standard deviation is 1.

<p>
2012-08-04 HumModRepository. Moved the log (this
file) up to the repository's home page. Want to
improve access.

<p>
2012-08-03 TheValidator (v1.0.1). Added Variables
main menu item. This menu item evokes a tabbed
dialog that lets you browse the models variables,
integrals, implicits and curves. May be useful after
a validation study produces a runtime error.

<p>
Wrote and pushed a brief users guild. Available at
Docs\UsersGuide.

<p>
2012-08-02 ModelSolver version bumped to v1.0.9.
Repaired a small error in the message parser.

<p>
2012-08-01 Pushing a pair of simulation tools,
TheValidator and TheBatchValidator. Will push
brief user's guides later when they are available.
Both utilities use the same schema and operate on
the same XML scripts.

<p>
TheValidator is interactive. It begins with a root
script and then lets you navigate to the validation
studies that are of current interest, avoiding time
consuming studies that not of interest.

<p>
TheBatchValidator begins with a root script also
(typically the same one) and sequentially does
all of the validation work in all of the child
scripts. Results are emitted as HTML and pushed
to Web site www.hummod.org/validation.

<p>
2012-07-31 The validation repo and Web site has had
a complete makeover using a new validation tool
called TheBatchValidator (not yet pushed, coming
soon).

<p>
2012-07-31 ModelSolver. Bumped version number to
v1.0.8. Added some muscle to the implicit equation
solver and fixed an off-by-one error that I think
was producing some annoying problems.

<p>
2012-07-25 Replacing Validator and ValidationTool
with TheValidator, a more interactive and desktop
oriented validation tool.

<p>
Validator and ValidationTool have been moved to
Archives.

<p>
2012-07-22 Started Blood Chemistry | Consult. This
service scans blood chemisty values and identifies
values that are too high or too low. XML is at
Structure\BloodChemistry. Visible at Diagnosis |
Blood Chemistry | Consult.

<p>
Respiratory and skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis,
metabolism and storage is now reported in both G
and molar units.

<p>
Up to now, some aspects of exercise physiology have
only been roughed out. Now I'm adding relevant detail.

<p>
SA-Node beta receptors was recalibrated to reflect a
strong neural (vs humoral) control of heart rate.
Documentation in Structure\Heart\SANode-BetaReceptors.REF.
Visible at Circulation | Heart Rate | Atria.

<p>
Arterial pressure (particularly SBP) increases in exercise.
We can expect a SBP of 170 - 180 mmHg at 200W.

<p>
Ekblom JAP 24:518-529, 1968.

<p>
This pressure increase is the result of the central
circulation having a greater tendency to pump blood
than the skeletal muscle has a tendency to vasodilate.
I had too much metabolic vasodilation in skeletal
muscle. Cut it back. Now pressure increases.

<p>
I moved the maximum tolerable lactate concentration for
skeletal muscle up from 30 mEq/L to 40 mEq/L. This will
benefit from additional data. 

<p>
2012-07-21 HumMod bumped version to v2.0.26. The major
edit here was a redo of the Suga-Sagawa model for the
right and left hearts. Transmural pressure (TMP) in
systole now has active and passive components. The
passive component is actually the diastolic P-V
relationship. As contractilty is lost, the TMP gracefully
degrades to the remaining passive component (ie. diastole).

<p>
2012-07-19 Model Solver bumped version to v1.0.7. Added
traps for invalid power function arguments. This function
is Math.Pow in C# and ^ binary operator in DES schema.

The C# edits are in MathOperators.CS. 

<p>
2012-07-19 HumMod bumped version to v2.0.25. HumMod will
cardiac arrest with severe acidosis. The XML is located
at Structure\Acidosis\CardiacArrest. Visible at Trauma |
Acidosis.

<p>
At the panel, you can choose never, chance or always.

<p>
2012-07-18 HumMod bumped version to v2.0.24. Respiratory
muscle metabolism is now a function of alveolar ventilation.
XML is at RespiratoryMuscle-Breathing with downstream
calculations at RespiratoryMuscle-Metabolism. Visible at
Organs | Respiratory Muscle | Breathing.

<p>
2012-07-18 InteractiveController bumped version to v1.1.8.
Put menu item 'X' in the main menu. Click on X to close
the current tabbed panel.

<p>
2012-07-17 InteractiveController. The default application
behavior on a parsing or runtime error is that the
application closes down. But this behavior can be overridden
using a selection in the Advanced tabbed dialog box.

<p>
All of the graphical panel elements are now clickable,
meaning that they expose underlying model variable values
when clicked.

<ul>
<li> Graph
<li> Bargraph
<li> Map
<li> Curve
<li> ValueBar
</ul>

<p>
2012-07-17 ScriptedController bumped to v2.0.4. Added the
scripting empty element continueonerror. After this element
is encountered in a script, runtime error details are silently
logged and execution of the script continues. Way cool!

<p>
2012-07-16 HumMod (v2.0.23). Put a spritz of initial [HCO3-]
into the brain to get it to start closer to steady-state.

<p>
Completely revised the respiratory center to allow it to
see (part of) the SID in the blood. The XML is in
RespiratoryCenter-Chemical. Visible at Respiration |
Respiratory Center | Chemical Drive.

<p>
2012-07-16 HumMod (v2.0.22). This version has compartments
for all lung gases with gas going in and out following
mass balance. XML in Structure\BloodGases. Stable integrals
were required. Visible at Respiration | Blood Gases.

<p>
Model can do breath holding. XML at Structure\BreathHolding.
Visible at Lifestyle | Breath Holding.

<p>
2012-07-11 HumMod (v2.0.21). Lung volumes are implemented,
but they have no function yet. Code at Lungs\LungVolumes
and panel at Respiration | Lung Volumes.

<p>
2012-07-11 Cerebrospinal fluid panel is complete. Visible
at Organs | Cerebrospinal Fluid.

<p>
2012-07-11 Glucose TMax in kidney is now a funcion of
nephron count. Code and panel locations are in a log
entry below.

<p>
2012-07-10 HumMod (v2.0.20). Added cerebrospinal fluid as
as organ. It doesn't do anything yet but secrete and absorb,
have a pressure (still under construction ... sorry).

<p>
2012-07-10 Put in a smooth transition in renal glucose
reabsorption between total reabsorption and maximal
reabsorption. Code is in Nephrons \ NephronGlucose.
Visible at Display | Organs | Kidney | Nephrons | More |
Glucose.

<p>
2012-07-10 Increased the TMax for Na+ a bit in distal tubule
and collecting duct. Still looking for trusted data.

<p>
2012-07-10 Repaired quantitation in distal tubule. Had too
large of an effect of Na+ delivery on K+ secretion. Data
was from David Young, incidently, but I interpretted it
carelessly.

<p>
2012-07-08 HumMod (v2.0.19). Pushing now. Insulin receptors
are complete.

Benchmarks. Stop insulin secretion. Blood levels of inulin
fall to about 40% of control at 10 hours. Severe ketoacidosis
at 1 day.

I am now completely redoing control of respiration to get
CSF into the model and to get acceptable metabolic and CO2
responses.

<p>
2012-07-04 General and hepatic insulin receptors with
general, hepatic and renal insulin degradation. Note that
the liver sees portal vein insulin concentration. Receptors
are visible at Hormones | Insulin | Receptors.

<p>
Insulin clearance is the sum of net liver binding, net
general binding and renal degradation. Visible at
Hormones | Insulin | Circulating.

<p>
Insulin's organ effects are a function of fractional
binding.

<p>
2012-07-01 HumMod (v2.0.19). Fuel uses organ plasma flow in
the denominator of some ratios. It also uses values derived
from O2 use in similar denominators. So when the model is
close to or in mortis, the organ flow or O2 use stops and
we get a divide by zero. Trapped this condition in all
twelve major organs.

<p>
2012-06-30 Starting to install insulin receptors.

<p>
2012-06-30 Repaired Organs | Organ Name | Fuel panel
labels. Most said Other Tissue rather than the actual
name of the organ.

<p>
2012-06-30 HumMod XML (v2.0.18). Added pituitary gland for
future development. Now has total, anterior and posterior
mass. Visible at Organs | Pituitary Gland.

<p>
2012-06-29. HumMod XML (v2.0.17) contains some small repairs
and styling.

<p>
2012-06-28. HumMod XML (v2.0.16) allows some randomness to
be added to any of the traits: age, height, adiposity,
muscularity and other mass. This allows multiple instances
to simulate a population. Visible and controlled at Context
| Summary.

<p>
2012-06-27. Pushing SolutionBrowser (v1.0.0). There is a
brief users guide in the documentation.

<p>
2012-06-24.Trends has been recast as SolutionBrowser with
a new github repo and a new VS C# project.

<p>
2012-06-23. Made a small edit to InteractiveController and
pushed. Hold down Ctrl key on launch to get to the Advanced
dialog box without having the application attempt a full
process.
 
<p>
2012-06-21. Bumped ScriptedController version to 2.0.3. Edited
<roster> and <rosteradd> elements to give <var> element
<name> and <format> child elements. Element <format> is
optional. When not specified, values are dumped without
formatting. Details in ScriptedController | Docs | Schema
| Script.

<p>
2012-06-19. Bumped InteractiveController version to 1.1.6.
Edited save solution and load solution schema to conform
with ScriptedController (and maybe also ValidationTool and
Validator).

<p>
2012-05-27. Resuming work on trends. 

<p>
2012-05-26. Pushed Validator v2.0.4 with some small changes
in function and some small fixes. Also pushed the Validation
repo with current Validator output.

<p>
2012-05-25. v2.0.2 changes the layout of a scripts results
file to
<br># Header
<br># Scores
<br># All of the rest in chronological order

<p>
2012-05-25. My bad. v2.0.0 did not have full change function.
Fixed and pushed v2.0.1.

<p>
2012-05-25. Validator (v2.0) has been pushed and is ready
for evaluation.

<p>
2012-05-23. Just an update here. Still working on the
Validator(v2.0). The basic stuff is great. Adding some
features.

<p>
2012-05-19. Totally rebuilding the Validator. Will bump
the version number to 2.

<p>
2012-05-18. Finished ValidationTool. Pushed version 1.0.0.
A sample script is located in Docs | Scripts.

<p>
2012-05-16. ValidationTool(v0.2.0). It parses, runs the
solver, shows Advanced. It parses test but doesn't calculate
the results, yet.

<p>
2012-05-16. Add general scripting schema documentation for
the ValadationTool and the Validator. In Docs | Schema |
Script | ... - OverviewScript.DOCX.

<p>
2012-05-15. Added folders, HTML and PNG's to the basic
validation Web site.

<p>
2012-05-13. Validation stuff now has its own repository
in github, named 'validation'. Like 'autodoc', this
repository is a Web site. You get their from the HumMod
Repository using the link 'http://hummod.github.com/validation.

<p>
The root file is the default 'index.html'.

<p>
Each model in the HumMod Repository can have its own
validation content. Right now, only HumMod(v2.0) has validation
content. You get to this content via Home | Models |
HumMod (v2.0) and the Validation button.

<p>
2012-05-11. Adding classes to ValidationTool. Still not
functional. But gaining,

<p>
2012-05-11. Creating a validation tool that is used
in building and testing validation scripts. Called
ValidationTool.EXE. This tool does not emit HTML and
does not interact with the Internet. Instead, it parses
validation scripts and displays or emits the test scores.
When a script or scripts are judged to be useful, they
can then be folded into a larger group or scripts that
are used in the global validation study. ValidationTool
runs locally in any location. I pushed a shell copy of
the code.

<p>
2012-05-10. Removed lots of dead code from
ScriptedController.

<p>
2012-05-09.  Revised pipe sequences in these four
applications. Files edited were IPC_InBox.CS and
IPC_OutBox.CS. In addition, tweaked MainWindow.CS in
ModelSolver. Pushed all four.

<p>
InteractiveController (1.1.5)
<br>
ScriptedController (2.0.1)
<br>
ModelSolver (1.0.6)
<br>
Validator (1.1.3)

<p>
2012-05-09. Pushed Scripted Controller (Version 2.0.0).
It has been lightly tested. Needs rigorous testing.

<p>
2012-05-01. The repository called HumModRepository on
my local workstation was pushed to github to become a
Web site biosim.github.com (www. is no loanger required).
Then we moved the host to hummod.github.com/autodoc.
This document is hosted in the repository be moved. So
if there is no further traffic on this topic, all of the
stuff at biosim.github.com will be presented at
hummod.github.com/autodoc.

<p>
2012-03-09. The next step is a total renovation of
the way context scales initial values.  

<p>
2012-03-09. HumMod's folder organization so far has
been to keep context stuff in a separate folder up
at the level of sturcture, control and display. But
really, context stuff is all structure -- so I made
it a subfolder under Structure. Deleted benchmarks.
Bumped version number to 2.0.15.

<p>
2012-03-09. Two script names (presumably primary and
sandbox) can now be specified and toggled. Visible at
Advanced | Startup. Version to 1.1.2. 

<p>
2012-03-09. Validator wants to run a predetermined script
at startup using information stored in the registry. But
if you don't want this, hold down the control key when
launching.

<p>
2012-03-09. The InteractiveController would not update an
open panel after the user did something on another panel
and then came to the former. Fixed. Bumped version to 1.1.4.

<p>
2012-03-07. Stripped all of the dead code out of Validator
and started routine use. There is no documentation but
there are plenty of scripts in the repository. v1.1.1.

<p>
2012-03-07. Totally rewrote Validator to simplify schema,
increase flexibility and improve internal structure.
Bumped version number to 1.1.0.

<p>
2012-03-06. Bumped version number to 1.0.2. Edited a type in
tabbed dialog Status.

<p>
2012-03-05. Working on some improvements to Validator. Bump
version number to 1.0.1.

<p>
2012-03-04. Validator is a simulation utility that parses and
executes scripts that control solutions. Validator collects
measures of prediction accuracy and emits this information as
Web pages in the HumMod Repository. Version 1.0.0 has just
been pushed.

<p>
Sub-folder organization is significant. Each sub-folder contains
one script named Script.Script. Validator takes this script and
emits an HTML version of it. Validator then executes the script
and emits the results as HTML into Results.HTML in the same
subfolder.

<p>
So after Validator has been run, each sub-folder contains three
files.

<p> # Script.Script (by the scipt author)
<br> # Script.HTML (by Validator)
<br> # Results.HTML (by Validator)

<p>
Some early results can be seen in the HumMod Repository
under Validation.

<p>
The Validator bottom line is that Validator takes care of all
of the Web site management. The script writer can focus solely
on creating scripts that accurately evaluate the performance
of the model.

<p>
2012-02-27. Changed the Settings menu item in the ModelSolver
to Advanced and added some tabs. Making some small changes in
ScriptedController as it is used to do validation. Added more
tabs to advanced.

<p>
2012-02-27. Refactored the pipe in both controllers and the
solver. Then bumped version numbers.

<p> Interactive Controller (v1.1.3)
<br> Scripted Controller (v1.1.6)
<br> Model Solver (v1.0.5)

<p>
2012-02-26. Added elements to the ScriptedController's scripting
schema to help accumlating, formatting and pasting to the results
log statistics generated by the Accept, Quality and Review tests.
The element names start with stats_. Documentation is in Docs at
ScriptedController\Docs\Schema\Script.

<p>
2012-02-26. Added script_to_html element to ScriptedController's
schema. This element tells the ScriptedController to take all of
the files contributing to the current script and make HTML
formatted copies of the files. Way cool, these copies can be
routed directly and automatically to the HumMod repository Web
site. A site visitor can see both the results of a script and
the script that created the results. Repository curator (currently)
must manually edit an index page for each of results and scripts.

<p>
2012-02-26. Bumped InteractiveController version to 1.1.5 with a
large number of edits underway.

<p>
2012-02-25. Completed implementing the scripted controller's
files element.

<p>
2012-02-25. Added some new elements to the scripted controller's
scripting schema so that statistics may be calculated, accumulated
and displayed on a local, regional or global basis. Will have
some documentation next.

<p>
2012-02-25. Bumped version numbers due to a variety of edits.

<p> Interactive Controller (v1.1.2)
<br> Scripted Controller (v1.1.4)
<br> Model Solver (v1.0.4)

<p>
2012-02-25. I modified the pipe a bit to tidy it up. I hope
that I didn't foul it up.

<p>
2012-02-24. Small edits to scripted controller.

<p>
2012-02-24. Interactive controller goes to v1.1.1 with better
implementation of the action button. Build date is now shown
in the dialog box. Model title now comes across from the model
solver in the large controllerinfo message. The title is then
added to controller's title bar (at the top of the main window).

<p>
2012-02-24. Model solver now treats action button as a top-level
asynchronous event. Responds with two new messages : actionbuttondone
and actionbuttonfailed. Version 1.0.3.

<p>
2012-02-23. All of the basic formatting code is in place in
ScriptedController and it is ready for use. But a large
amount of further refinement is forthcoming

<p>
2012-02-23. Fixed ActionButton problem. The problem was in
the ModelSolver which thought that an action button message
was actually an action button display element. Thanks Drew.

<p>
2012-02-23. Bumped version to v1.1.3. Refactored file I/O. 

<p>
2012-02-22. ScriptedController edits are moving right along.

<p>
2012-02-22. Bumped ScriptedController to v1.1.2 as edits continue.

<p>
2012-02-22. Expanded the HumModRepository to store and display the
scripts used in model validation.

<p>
2012-02-21. Well into final part of this redo, which is implementing
the emit element. Emit lets a script specify the results log
formatting as: TEXT, XML, or HTML.

<p>
2012-02-21. Cleaned up code that handles a missing startup script
(named in command line or registry).

<p>
2012-02-21. Bumped ScriptedController to v1.1.1 as edits continue.

<p>
2012-02-20. There may have been a long standing error in getting
startup script names out of the registry. Startup code has been
refactored. Looks and works good.

<p>
2012-02-20. New scripting elements have been added to schema and
to code. Documentation is up to date in Docs | Schema | Script. 

<p>
2012-02-20. Bumped ScriptedController to v1.1.0. A major remake
is underway.

<p>
2012-02-20. Added three elements to the Scripted Controller's
scripting schema (no coding yet, just documentation). These
elements should be useful when we are routing Scripted
Controller output directly to a Web site.

<p>
The new elements are

<p>&lt;parent&gt; ... &lt;/parent&gt;
<br>&lt;homepath&gt; ... &lt;/homepath&gt;
<br>&lt;breadcrumbs&gt; ... &lt;/breadcrumbs&gt;

<p>
2012-02-20. Roughed out the model validation section in
the HumMod Repository. Try Validation | HumMod(v2.0) |
Initial Values ... 

<p>
2012-02-19. Following Marek's suggestion, renal efferent
blood flow was broken down into some of its component
parts. Details are visible at Organs | Kidney | Vascular
Segments | Efferent Artery. 

<p>
2012-02-19. Added vascular conductance on a /G basis to :
right heart, left heart, hepatic artery, hepatic vein,
kidney.

<p>
2012-02-19. Bumped version to 2.0.13.

<p>
2012-02-18. Putting in all vascular conductance as a /G
function of organ weight (ie scaled). About 1/2 done.

<p>
2012-02-18. I didn't have lactate metabolism quite right,
and after two weeks the lactate mass in the kidney went to
zero triggering a divide by zero in the fuel selector. I
think that this is fixed with improved physiology actually.

<p>
2012-02-18. Bumped version to 2.0.12.

<p>
2012-02-17. Marek pointed out that I was cutting corners on
this calculation by assuming a pulse pressure in the stroke
volume calculation (using the Suga-Sagawa heart model). The
rigorous calculation is now in place, using an implicit
algebraic equation. SBP in aorta and pulmonary artery is
defined by the implicit. Stoke volume is calculated and used
to calculate the end value of SBP. The calculation crosses
several structures, but it should be a very benign calculation.

<p>
2012-02-17. Values for left and right side stenosis and regurg
are now in groupboxes in the left and right heart pumping
panels.

<p>
2012-02-17. Code and panels are now installed in all 12 major
organs for the new fuel selector.

<p>
2012-02-16. Starting a data section in HumMod repository for
dietary sodium intake. Will use this data later for model
validation.

<p>
2012-02-15. Modified the Model Solver so that it can return
the model's title when requested. The Scripted Controller can
use this information when doing validations. The incoming
message is &lt;requesttitle/&gt; and the outgoing message is
&lt;title&gt; Title &lt;/title&gt;.

<p>
The title contains the model's version number.

<p>
Bumped the Model Solver's version number to 1.0.1.

<p>
2012-02-14. I created a new, way cool fuel selector. It is
initially installed in other tissues.

<p>
2012-02-14. There is now water vapor in inspired air. The
calculation is based on relative humidity. There is also a
water vapor gas tank. Air is humidified in the bronchi
(added groupbox) and insensible loss is calculated using
the amount of H2O added. This advance was suggested by
Drew. 

<p>
2012-02-14. Bumped version to 2.0.11.

<p>
2012-02-13. The big increase in arterial pO2 at the start of
exercise is gone, probably because cardiac output is increasing
more accurately.

<p>
2012-02-13. CO2 balance is now calculated in detail, including
renal bicarb excretion (suggested by Marek). Results are
displayed in a panel at Respiration | CO2 | Balance.

<p>
2012-02-13. Hunger is now a function of [Glucose] and
[Leptin].

<p>
2012-02-13. Redid mass balance and thermodynamics in GI
lumen.

<p>
2012-02-13. Bumped version to 2.0.10.

<p>
2012-02-12. Expanded the Lifestyle menu Diet to include
Hunger | Thirst and Control. Temperature of ingested food
and water may now be specified.

<p>
2012-02-12. Bumped version number to 2.0.9.

<p>
2012-02-11. Replaced the numerical methods in the pulmonary
circulation with a better way to do the hemodynbamics. I like
the results.

<p>
2012-02-11. Rescaled initial plasma protein to get an initial
COP of 28 mmHg. COP was starting at 26, which caused some
plasma leak into the IFV. Then scaled interstitial protein
for the first time to get an initial COP of around 8 mmHg.

<p>
2012-02-11.Added an Energy section, with Energy-Stores and
Energy-Tools structures. The first idea here is to calculated
and display total energy stored in the body, including lipid
and glycogen. Panel is visible as Energy Stores on the
Metabolism menu.

<p>
2012-02-11. Bumped version to 2.0.8.

<p>
2012-02-10. VascularCompartments keep their name in structures,
but are displayed under Circulation as Blood Vessels. Then in
the Blood Vessels menu, there is a Great Veins menu selection.
It shows panels for Superior Vena Cava, Coronary Sinus and
Inferior Vena cava.

<p>
2012-02-10. Revised Circulation | OrganFlow to prepare for
a superior and inferior vena cava. Right and left hearts now
drain into the right atrium through the coronary sinus, as
recommended by Marek.

<p>
2012-02-10. Bumped version to 2.0.7.

<p>
2012-02-09. Fixed middle and lower torso water problem as
reported by both Marek and Radu.

<p>
2012-02-09. Add lots of new pages to the Normal Values Web
site.

<p>
2012-02-08.Adding spreadsheet sheets and Web pages to Normal
Values in HumModRepository. 

<p>
2012-02-08. Cleaned up the layout in respiratory muscle size.
There was groupbox overlap.

<p>
2012-02-06. The idea right now is to put a lot of function
into a spreadsheet so that model scaling becomes algorithmic.
So far, so good. Added the basic building blocks like organ
mass and organ blood flow. The tougher stuff will come
later.

<p>
2012-02-05. Redesigned the Normal Values section of the
HumModRepository and started adding pages.

<br> General - Organ Mass
<br> General - Gender
<br> General - Blood Pressures
<br> General - Blood Flow

<p>
2012-02-04. Added major new section to HumModRepository titled
Normal Values with subsections Male 37 Years and Female 37 Years.

<p>
2012-02-04. Bumped version number to 2.0.6.

<p>
2012-02-03. Increased the initial CO2 mass in the brain a little
to get a better starting brain pH.

<p>
2012-02-03. Changed the name of BloodPh structure to BloodPhValues. 

<p>
2012-02-03. Add groupbox that announces gender at gender specific
organs : ovaries, uterus, testes. 

<p>
2012-02-03. Removed stimulators menu item and panel from Intervention.
Model had a couple of neural stimulators but I'm switching to clamps
to have consistency across the model.

<p>
2012-02-03. In menus and panels, RHPumping goes to RightHeartPumping,
LHPumping goes to LeftHeartPumping and Contractility goes to
HeartStrength. Left Heart and Right Heart Heart Strength, Contractile
Protein and Work get group boxes  -- in one case to separate
radiobuttons and in all cases to improve the look.

<p>
2012-02-03. Arterial hemorrhage can now be fixed rate or pressure
driven. Panel is under Trauma.

<p>
2012-02-03. Bumped version number to 2.0.5.


<p>
2012-02-02. Modeled coronary sinus. Variables are 

<p>
2012-02-02. Added posture energy. The code is in PostureEnergy.
The panel is under Miscellaneous | Orthostasis.

<p>
2012-02-02. Added heart mechanoreceptors code and panels at
autonomics afferents and autonomics CNS. Tidied up vagus nerve.

<p>
2012-02-02. Bumped version number to 2.0.4.

<p>
2012-02-01. Removed SequesteredBV from the Nerves | Autonomics |
Efferents menu. Installed Alpha Receptors menu item at Miscellaneous 
Orthostatics | Sequestered Blood. Added a panel. Edited sequestered
blood in arteries and veins to show effect of alpha agonist on
pressure-volume relationship.

<p>
2012-02-01. Renamed the SympsChemo structure to ChemoreceptorsCNS.
Then wrote the code and panel for the CNS processing of
chemoreceptor afferent nerve activity.

<p>
2012-02-01. Added code and panel for Cushing response.

<p>
2012-02-01. Added code and panel for CNS trophic factor.

<p>
2012-02-01. Bumped version number to 2.0.3.

<p>
2012-01-31. Edited code, added panels and boxes for afferent
autonomic nerves and central integration of the metaboreflex.
Also fleshed out its effect on the respiratory center.

<p>
Completing and redoing chemoreceptors.

<p>
2012-01-31. Bumped version number to 2.0.2.

<p>
2012-01-30. Added a data set to the HumModRepository. It
is visible at Data | Acid-Base | Ketoacidosis.

<p>
2012-01-29. Two structures were added under Structures \
Morphology. They are Volume.DES and Density.DES. These
structures calculate the volume and the density of the
body.

<p>
Then Display\Diagnosis was edited to replace Morphology
menu item with a Size menu. The Size panels show morphology,
body mass, body volume and body density in detail.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added group boxes and tidied up panels for

<p class='Indent'>
Display\Hormones\CRF\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Cortisol\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\PTH\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Vitamin D\... 4 Panels.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added tissue details to Pancreas. Details are
visible in Organs | More | Pancreas.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added tissue details to Adrenal Gland. Details are
visible in Organs | More | Adrenal Gland.

<p>
2012-01-29. Bumped HumMod XML version number to 2.0.1. Plan to
bump daily now with all of the edits going in.

<p>
2012-01-28. With the Win32 library (HumMod.EXE), the programmer
must group the radiobuttons into functional groups. With C# and
WinForms, all of the radiobuttons with the same parent are
considered to be in the same group. I had some panels with more
than one group of radiobuttons on the surface. Parenthood was
clarified by putting groups of buttons in appropriate group
boxes. Panels that were edited :

<p class='Indent'>
Display\Hormones\ACTH\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Calcitonin\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Cortisol\...

<p>
More panel edits to follow.

<p>
2012-01-28. Installed placeholder folders and files for adrenal
gland and pancreas. Organ weights are visible at <i>Organs</i>
| <i>More</i>. Folders and files created :

<p class='Indent'>

<p>
2012-01-28. Thanks to Drew Pruett for this fix. And also Marek. Renin
flux between free renin and granules had derivative signs reversed,
which violated conservation of mass and caused big problems in many
simulations after time had advanced about a week. Files edited :

2012-01-27. To get solution control and display information from
the model solver, the model controller sends a <i>requestcontrollerinfo/</i>
empty message. The controller has a response that was prepared during
model parsing and replies with a <i>controllerinfo</i> ...
<i>/controllerinfo</i> message wrapped around the info.

<p>
2012-01-27. You can edit the content for the <i>hidewindow</i>
element below to <i>True</i> to hide the model solver's main
window. Generally, Windows won't let you hide an application's
main window, but you can minimize and not show it in the task
bar to make it completely disappear.

<p class='Indent'>
WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized ;

<br>
ShowInTaskbar = false ;

<p>
If there is a messup, use the task manager to mop up. Note that the
only way to get the window back is to edit the INI file back to
<i>False</i>.

<p>
2012-01-27. The model solver uses an INI file in place of Windows
registry.

<code>
<P>&lt;ini&gt;
  <p class='Indent'> &lt;windowtop&gt; 136 &lt;/windowtop&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowleft&gt; 776 &lt;/windowleft&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowhigh&gt; 174 &lt;/windowhigh&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowwide&gt; 341 &lt;/windowwide&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowstate&gt; 0 &lt;/windowstate&gt;
  <br> &lt;pipeinterval&gt; 200 &lt;/pipeinterval&gt;
  <br> &lt;hidewindow&gt; False &lt;/hidewindow&gt;
<p>&lt;/ini&gt;
</code>

<p>
2012-01-27. Model controllers launch the model solver and pass the model
name and location in using the command line. On the desktop it might be
possible to use the defaults by putting the model controller, model
solver and model root file all in the same folder.

<p>
But a better idea might be to specify the model solver and model using
the model controller's <i>Advanced</i> menu selection.

<p>
<img src='DialogShowingSolverAndModel.PNG'>

<p>
The defaults are

<p class='Indent'>
Solver : Model Solver.exe

<br>
Model : HumMod.DES

<p>
2012-01-27. The Model Solver now parses the entire model and tucks
information that might be needed by the model controller into a cache.

<p>
2012-01-27. The development and use of Builder and BuilderXML has been
discontinued. Repository content has been moved to the Archives repo and
the Builder and BuilderXML repo's have been deleted.

<p>
2012-01-26. I created separate documentation sections in HumModRepository
for HumMod(1_6) release and HumMod(2_0) being developed.

<br>
<img src='ReleaseVersions.PNG'>

<p>
2012-01-19. Created this log to record the edits applied to HumMod's XML
files. T.C.
