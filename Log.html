<span class='Banner'> HumMod Repository Log </span>

<p>
2013-02-02. HumMod version bumped to 2.0.43.

<p>
Under Display | Organs | Kidney, HumMod had a ... Nephrons
submenu. I added a second submenu labeled ... Excretion
listing panels related to renal excretion -- most notable
the Urine panel.

<p>
I'm not totally sure about this, but after doing some
reading I demoted inorganic phosphate and sulfate from
strong anions to weak anions in the blood SID calculation
and display. Math is at Structure\BloodIons\BloodIons.DES.
Display is at Diagnosis | Blood Chemistry | Sample.

<p>
Moved Metabolism | Lipid Deposits to Organs | ... Lipid
Deposits under Adipose Tissue.

<p>
Moved Metabolism | Liver Metabolism to Organs | ... Metabolism
under Liver.

<p>
2013-02-01. HumMod version bumped to 2.0.42.

<p>
In response to a report from Matteo Pecchiari in Milan,
I checked out HumMod's bladder. It does accumulate protein.
Added clinical units for [Protein] of mG/dL and calculated
severity of proteinuria as Trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+. Structure
is at Bladder\BladderProtein. Display is at Organs | Bladder
using a new Proteinuria box. Severity is described in info
box.

<p>
2013-02-01. Adding some comments on launching ScriptedController
with the script to be run specified in the command line.

<p>
The ScriptedController plus script info can be launched using
the Command Prompt utility (cmd.exe) or a shortcut to the
ScriptedController configured with the requisite information.
In both cases, the information needed is identical.

<p>
A word about Windows. Windows supplies applications with two
items descibing the command line. The first is a string with
the complete contents of the command line. The second is an
array of strings with the contents of the command line parsed
into the array. The delimiter for this parser is whitespace.
So a path containing one or more spaces is potential trouble.

<p>
To make this work, the system parser treats all text within
double quotes as a single item. You can see this working by
right clicking any desktop icon and then selecting properties.
Notice the target specification safely in double quotes.

<p>
SciptedController expects the name of the app in array element
zero (which it ignores) and the XML script specification in
array element one. So when using the Command Promptput or a
shortcut put a pair of double quotes around the application
specification and a second pair of double quotes around the
script specification XML.

<ul>
<li> Double quotes around app and script specification.
<li> Single quotes won't work.
<li> File names, paths and drive letters are not case sensitive
in Windows.
<li> The .exe or .EXE name extension for executables is optional
but the .Script (or whatever) name extension is required for
scripts.
<li> Use properly formed and valid XML as decribed below.
</ul>

<p>
2013-01-31. The command line schema for the ScriptedController
is

<p>
&ltroot&gt;&ltscript&gt; Valid Script Name &lt/script&gt;&lt/root&gt;

<p>
XML content in the command line takes precedence over the
startup information in the registry. Note also that you
can hold down the control key (Ctrl) when launching the
ScriptedController and both the command line content and
registry information will be ignored.

<P>
2013-01-28. This log described mods made to HumMod on
2012-11-05 upgrading the fuel selector. The version was 2.0.39.
But this version was never pushed so I've deleted the notes
and will recreate the appropriate mods now.

<p>
2013-01-28. HumMod version bumped to 2.0.41.

<p>
HumMod previously used a linear predictor to predict fatty
acid vs. glucose use in each of the major organs. This
worked OK with normal deliveries but not with unusual
deliveries -- specifically brain ketoacid use during
startvation.

<p>
So I replaced this predictor with a non-linear one that
is much better. The expense is that fatty acid preference
is no longer a working parameter. There is a detailed
reference in Structure\FuelSelector. The new predictor
is visible at 'Organ' | Fuel for each organ.

<p>
2013-01-27. Bumped HumMod 2.0.39 to 2.0.40.

<p>
I've renamed the structure folder and structure file
from VascularCompartments to BloodVessels. This is
just a matter of style.

<p>
Reorganized the menus and panels under Circulation |
Blood Vessels to create 3 major groupings

<ul>
<li> Arteries
<li> Veins
<li> Lungs
</ul>

<p>
2013-01-26. Bumped HumMod 2.0.38 to 2.0.39.

<p>
There were 4 occurances in 2 files where the empty
element &lt;integer/&gt; was referred to as
&lt;integer&gt;. Fixed.

<p>
The goal is to go 1 week in steady-state in 2000
steps or less. But 2.0.38 would slow at about 5
days and required about 5300 steps. This slowing
was caused by LeftAtrium.DxMax being slightly too
large (0.005 * Compliance) -- leading to a bit of
jitter. So I decreased it to 0.0001 * Compliance.
Now it uses 2207 steps (460 retries) in EXE and
2231 steps (513 retries) in Modular.

<p>
2013-01-12. The design with ScriptedController and
InteractiveController is to use simple schemas for
saving and loading initial conditions and solutions.
These two schemas were installed about a year ago
(I'm guessing). Older files will not be compatible
and will not parse.

<p>
These two schemas are specified in the applications
at Docs\Schemas\... and are repeated here.

<p>
&lt;ics&gt;
<br>
&lt;var&gt;
<br>
&lt;name&gt; Name &lt;/name&gt;
<br>
&lt;val&gt; Value &lt;/val&gt;
<br>
&lt;/var&gt;
<p>
More vars here.
<p>
&lt;/ics&gt;

<p>
&lt;solution&gt;
<br>
&lt;var&gt;
<br>
&lt;name&gt; Name &lt;/name&gt;
<br>
&lt;val&gt; Value &lt;/val&gt;
<p>
More values here.
<p>
&lt;/var&gt;
<p>
More vars here.
<p>
&lt;/solution&gt;

<p>
Note that unstructured text is allowed before the
opening root tag and after the closing root tag.

<p>
2013-01-08. In the ClientController, the pipe polling
interval appears to be 1000 mS, as seen in Advanced |
Pipe. This interval (which is large) could add to the
latency. The default interval for the other modular
components is 200 mS -- providing pretty decent
performance.

<p>
2013-01-07. Some of the tests reported below used a
desktop with an Internet connection. Characterized
the desktop using Belarc Adviser. It is an HP with
4 core AMD running at 2.9 gHz on 6 mBytes RAM.

<p>
Characterized the Internet connection using speedtest.net.

<ul>
<li>
Ping : 10 mSec
<li>
Download : 19.8 mBytes/Sec
<li>
Upload : 3.6 mBytes/Sec
</ul>

<p>
2013-01-07. Then pinged some destinations that we
use. Results are reported in mSec.

<ul>
<li>
hummod.org : 60 mSec
<li>
digitalhumanmodels.org : 94 mSec
<li>
biosim.com : ICMP is blocked, but rather fast.
<li>
ip-50-63-52-240.ip.secureserver.net : 69 mSec --
this is the URL that the ClientController talks
to (more on this below).
<li>
solveradmin.connect-technologies.net : 69 mSec
<li>
github.com : 59 mSec
<li>
google.com : 75 mSec
</ul>

<p>
2013-01-07. Restart on HumMod.EXE is too quick to be
measured -- maybe 10 to 100 mSec. Restart on client -
server is 2.97 Sec. Considering nearly zero elapsed
time on the controller and on the model solver, it
appears that the time cost of communication for a
single transaction is about 3 seconds. Note that a
restart returns a values frame and all of the starting
map data. Client to server communication was 1 message
in 1792 bytes. Server to client communication was 1
message in 183,285 bytes.

<p>
But some of the time cost in the above test may be due
to message size. So I picked Advanced | Variables and
then clicked on a variable name. This triggers a round
trip fetch of details for the named variable -- with
very small message content. Client to server is 1
message in 65 bytes. Server to client is 1 message in
216 bytes. Elapsed time was 2.88 seconds. So the
latency appears to be inherent and only slightly
dependent on the message size.

<p>
2013-01-06. Summary of 6 hour, steady-state protocol
in various environments. Values are elapsed time in
seconds.

<ul>
<li>
HumMod.EXE : 3.32 Seconds.
<li>
Interactive Controller - Model Solver : 5.15 Seconds.
<li>
Scripted Controller - Model Solver : 4.18 Seconds.
<li>
Client - Server : 7.41 Seconds.
<li>
HumModWeb : 2.67 Seconds.
</ul>

<p>
2013-01-06. One more 6 hour steady-state protocol. This
one used HumModWeb (v1.0.1) with the source XML coming
from HumMod v2.0.0 (I think) (266,934 tags). The
environment was the same desktop used in the other tests,
Windows 7 and FireFox 17.0.1.

<p>
Loading required 9.8 seconds and the 6 hours steady-state
test was completed in 2.67 seconds. First and repeated
simulations were all roughly the same speed.

<p>
2013-01-06. ClientController Notes

<p>
The most recent ClientController has its own application
name, icon and registry key. The executable is smaller
than before, suggesting that the debugging hooks have
been removed.

<p>
ClientController.exe 1,128,960 bytes 6/28/2012 (Old)
<br>
ClientController.exe   324,608 bytes 1/6/2013 (Current)

<p>
We also need a config file present in the executable
directory -- for some unknown reason.

<p>
ClientController.exe.config 1,742 bytes 6/28/2012 (Old)
<br>
ClientController.exe.config 1,873 bytes 1/6/2013 (Current)

<p>
To install the ClientController, go to Advanced | 
Solver - Model.

<p>
The solver specification must point to any existing path
on the client machine. It is parsed and then ignored. I
made the mistake of setting it to an empty string. The
path parser failed, threw an exception, and shut down
the client. The only way to repair this, I think, is to
use regedit.exe to enter the registry and edit in a
valid entry.

<p>
The the model specification is significant since it
points to the model XML on the server. The correct
entry is

<p>
c:\Websites\HumMod\library\HumMod.DES

<p>
2013-01-06. I repeated the 6 hour steady-state protocol
described below using the server - client environment and
the same desktop as used below. HumMod version was 2.0.15.

<p>
Startup (launch client to draw chart panel) required 21
seconds. Model solver used 2.81 seconds to parse the XML
(274,092 tags). This suggests that the server is fast enough,
but keep in mind that no disk writes are involved. Client
used 3.70 seconds to parse the display message (562 panels).
This is rather slow. Startup messaging consisted of 3
messages in 2020 bytes from client to server and 4 messages
in 2,827,261 bytes from server to client.

<p>
The 6 hour steady-state protocol runs in 7.41 seconds. The
display interval with this version of HumMod is 60 minutes,
so a total of 6 value frames were returned (1235 mS per
frame). The solution used 190 steps and 46 retries with an
average step size of 1.89 minutes. Messaging consisted of
1 message in 107 bytes from client to server and 6 messages
in 805,478 bytes from server to client.

<p>
There appears to be a large amount of network traffic involving
the client and server EVEN when both the client and model
solver are idle. No bytes are moved so this appears to be
handshaking. Traffic stops when the client is closed. This
can be monitored using Resource Monitor.

<p>
2013-01-04. I ran some timing tests to get basic information
before jumping into the compression discussion. Tests involved
6 hours of steady-state with no run in at the start. Solution
interval was 360 minutes with display at 30 minutes. All tests
used HumMod v2.0.39.

<p>
The first test used HumMod.EXE. Elapsed time was 3.32 seconds.
Solution required 328 steps with 17 retries. Average step size
was 1.1 minutes. In this environment, there is no communication
time since the solver algorithm writes directly into the display
buffer. Visible panel is updated (including graphs). A total of
12 solution sets was delivered by the solver to the display buffer.
Note that this version of HumMod uses its own numerical methods,
so results may not compare directly to the following test.

<p>
So the take away here is that solution and panel refresh for
this protocol requires about 277 mS per display interval with
no communication cost. The cost of solution vs. cost of panel
update cannot be teased out.

<p>
The second test used the Interactive Controller (v1.1.14) and
the Model Solver (v1.0.14). The pipe polling interval was
200 mS. Elapsed time was 5.16 seconds. Solution required 321
steps with 16 retries. Average step size was 1.12 minutes. The
same 12 sets were delivered by the solver through the bidirectional
pipe. Visible panel is updated (including graphs).

<p>
A repeat took 4.95 seconds. Controller to Solver communications
consisted of 1 message and 107 bytes. Solver to Controller
communications consisted of 6 messages and 882610 bytes. Note
that more than one values frame will be packed into a message
if solution values are available in a timely fashion.

<p>
So the take away here is that solution plus communication plus
panel update requires 430 mS per display interval. Using the
previous results yields 277 mS for solution and display and 153
mS for communication. The only significant communication runs
from Solver to Controller. The communication cost consists of
message creation, transport, and message parsing and consumption.
Note that Controller and Solver are both running on the same
CPU, so that time slicing is at work.

<p>
For perspective, I profiled the startup timing -- when the Model
Controller is launched and it in turn launches the Model Solver
and it in turn parses the model. Startup is complete when the
Controller displays the first panel and signals 'Ready'.
Elapsed time was 8.65 seconds. Model Solver parsing time was
2.73 seconds (303400 tags). Model Controller parsing time was
0.89 seconds (602 panels defined in an incoming message).

<p>
Checking the message boxes showed that Controller to Solver
messages consisted of 3 messages and 6912 bytes. Solver to
Controller messages consisted of 4 messages and 3209222 bytes.
These are all one time messages used to install the Controller.

<p>
The absolute fastest that the model can run when it is in
steady-state and after it has settled into steady-state. To
document this, I ran for 6 hours and then an additional 6
hours -- timing the second part of the protocol. When looking
at these numbers, there is a very important consideration --
after the solver receives a gofor or goto message, it does
not wait on the pipe. It calculates away until the solution
is complete and results (value frames) are dumped into the
pipe (or its buffer) as they become available.

<p>
The Solver advanced the solution in 113 steps and 26 retries
over 1.70 seconds or 142 mS per display interval. This is as
fast as it will go. The Controller required 2.77 seconds or
231 mS per display interval. 

<p>
I'm just going to review message traffic here to make sure.
<br>
Startup : 3 To Solver in 6912 Bytes. 4 to Controller in 3209222 Bytes.
<br>
First 6 Hours : 1 to Solver in 107 Bytes. 6 to Controller in 882610 Bytes.
<br>
Second 6 Hours : 1 to Solver in 107 Bytes. 6 to Controller in 884515 Bytes.

<p>
Next, I wrote a script that duplicated the 6-hour steady-state
protocol and executed it using the Scripted Controller. Total
elased time was 12 seconds. Script parsing time was 0.03
seconds and model parsing time was 2.75 seconds. There were
3 Controller to Solver messages of 259 bytes and 13 Solver to
Controller messages of 2151794 bytes. These Controller incoming
messages were both startup and solution messages.

<p>
Solution used 327 steps and 15 retries with an average step-size
of 1.10 minutes. Solution elapsed time was 4.18 seconds.

<p>
Total Takeaway (based on impressions rather that hard numbers).
Values are in mS per display interval.
<br> Solution : 142 and up. Depends on size of interval and transients.
<br> Calculating : 132 and up.
<br> Waiting For Timeslice : 10. Could be faster or slower on server.
<br> Panel Update : 1. Will be slower when maps are visible.
<br> Messaging : 100
<br> Message Creation : 1
<br> Transport : 49 for file system. Might be slower over the wires,
but might be faster since multiple processors are involved.
<br> Parsing : 40
<br> Polling Inefficiency : 10 but none over Internet

<p>
Remember that after decompressing the complete message must still be
parsed. So the critical question is whether or not the time required to
compress and decompress is more or less than the time saved in transporting
a smaller message. An algorithm such as ZIP is great on size but terrible
on time, so it will probably will be bad news. What is a better algorithm?
I don't know.

<p>
The other thing that strikes me is that the rate limiting step is either
the rate at which the server can calculate and push out packets or the
rate at which the browser can consume the packet. For the first display
interval in a solution, the transport time might be significant. At all
other times, it won't be significant and the compression / decompression
will just be an added burden.

<p>
And then another thing struck me. Windows (I think) does a delayed write
in its file system. This means that it actually writes to memory and then
flushes memory to the disk drive later when it is not busy. But if we
run a pipe that gets a write and 200 mS or less does a read and then
delete, the data never goes to disk and the system is fast. So the
numbers that I got here could be fast and misleading.

<p>
2012-12-18. ScriptedController version bumped to 2.0.10 with
a try-catch construct added to StorageDumper.MakeRoster().

<p>
ScriptedController was throwing an <i>ArgumentOutOfRangeException</i>
on the following sequence.

<ul>

<li>
ScriptedController is executing a script and asks the ModelSolver
to change a value or to advance the solution.

<li>
But a runtime error occurs and the expected results don't come back.

<li>
Instead, a run report comes back. It is displayed or logged.

<li>
Then execution of the script continues. If the script attempts to
dump the expected results specified by index, the results are not
there and the specified index is out of range. An exception is
thrown.

</ul>

<p>
So we try to get a value at the specified index. But if the value
does not exist, the index is out of range. An exception is thrown
AND caught. We then use "N/A" as the image.

<p>
2012-12-12. Added data and references to the Starvation
page in HumMod Repository under data.

<p>
2012-12-08. Added a page with data on posture and hemodynamics
using data from Loring Rowell. Visible in HumMod Repository
under Data | Posture &amp; Hemodynamics. Good references.

<p>
2012-12-07. ModelSolver.EXE has been repaired and its
version number bumped to 1.0.14.

<p>
Thanks to Drew for pointing out this problem. ModelSolver's
XML parser did not process relative file names correctly.
The offending code is in PFileManager.CS. I never liked this
code and now it has been repaired using the proper .Net
calls.

<p>
Fully qualified file name - Complete name from drive letter
to file extension.

<br>
Relative name - name and location of a file relative to the
current directory.

<br>
Current directory - a directory location stored by the
operating system. By default it is the directory holding
the executable code.

<p>
The HumMod XML parser should be able to handle both
fully qualified and relative file names as specified by
the <i>include</i> and <i>path</i> processing instructions.
But it botched a relative name in the model solver's root
directory. Fixed. My bad.

<p>
2012-11-03. Here is what I put in 
InsulinReceptors-Liver.REF.

<p>
<i>
Hepatic insulin receptors can really scarf up
the insulin. So net binding is always flow
limited to some extent. This is very important
when hepatic plasma flow is low.
<i>

<p>
So HumMod uses mass balance at hepatic insulin
uptake. XML at Structure\Insulin\InsulinReceptors-Liver.
Visible at Hormones | Insulin | Beta Cells | Insulin
Receptors.

<p>
2012-11-03. Insulin concentration in the pool is now
also available in pMol/L.

<p>
2012-11-03. Broke insulin formation into separate
synthesis and secretion panels to provide more detailed
information. No new XML. Visible at Hormones | Insulin
| Beta Cells and then Synthesis and Secretion.

<p>
2012-11-03. HumMod now calculates and displays [Insulin]
at the pancreas beta cells. This concentration modulates
insulin secretion. XML at Structure\Pancreas\Insulin.
Visible at Organs | Pancreas | Insulin and Hormones |
Insulin | Beta Cells | Secretion.

<p>
2012-11-03. HumMod now calculates and displays [Glucagon]
at the pancreas alpha cells. This concentration modulates
glucagon secretion. XML at Structure\Pancreas\Glucagon.
Visible at Organs | Pancreas | Glucagon and Hormones |
Glucagon | Alpha Cells.

<p>
2012-11-02. Skeletal muscle metabolism did not respond
(at all) to changes in posture -- because the logic in
PostureEnergy was not properly coded. My bad. Fixed.
Thanks to Drew for documenting this one.

<p>
2012-11-02. The correct descriptor of renal alpha
agonism is Kidney-AlphaReceptors.Activity. Activity
normal value is 1.0. Incorrect references (parameter
stubs) were replaced in Structure\Nephrons\ProximalTubule\PT_Na
and Structure\Nephrons\VasaRecta. And, thanks to Drew for
this one.

<p>
2012-11-02. HumMod v2.0.38. The correct case for the
system constant pi is 'Pi'. Replaced 'PI' with 'Pi'
in Structure\Orthostatics\Hydrostatics. Tilt table
is now functional. And, thanks again  to Drew for this
one.

<p>
2012-11-02. Total, endocrine, alpha cell, beta cell,
delta cell, other cell and exocrine blood flow. XML
is at Structure\Pancreas and then Pancreas-Flow. Visible
at Organs | Pancreas | Circulation.

<p>
2012-11-02. Need a conductance scaler obtained from the
GI tract to scale the adrenal gland and pancreas. Its
name is Conductance_X_Normal. XML in GITract-Flow.
Visible under Organs at GI Tract | Circulation and also
at the Adrenal Gland and Pancreas.

<p>
2012-11-02. The hemodynamics of the portal vein, hepatic
artery and hepatic vein are now visible at Circulation |
Blood Vessels | Splanchnic Veins. Portal vein blood flow
and constituents are now visible at Organs | ... Portal
Vein.

<p>
2012-11-02. A blood chemistry consult must now be requested
rather than being automatic. Of course, a sample is needed. 

<p>
2012-11-02. HumMod v2.0.37. Gave [Glucagon] additionalal physical
units of pMol/L. XML in Structure\Glucagon. Visible in Hormones
| Glucagon. 

<p>
2012-11-01. Starvation simulations indicate that additional
precision is needed at insulin and glucagon into the portal
circulation. I'll build this on a detailed pancreas circulatory
system.

<p>
But to warm up, I built a detailed adrenal gland circulation.
XML is at Structure\AdrenalGland. Visible at Organs | Adrenal
Gland.

<p>
2012-11-01. By the second day of starvation, insulin mass
(and [Insulin]) have gone negative. Needs some work on hepatic
insulin receptor binding. Loss of physiology out at the edges.
Next.

<p>
2012-11-01. Blood chemistry is now displayed as the result of
a blood sample. There is a separate panel for blood gases.
XML in Structure\BloodGases. Visible under Diagnosis.

<p>
2012-11-01. Some submenus seemed too deep to me and this was a
pain. Specifically moved up GI Lumen and Nephrons to the next
higher menu -- Organs. Show child-like dependence using elipses
(...).

<p>
2012-10-30. Absoption of water from the gut lumen could continue
all the way down to a negative volume. Added limits that stop
absorption when the gut is empty. XML at Structure\GILumen and
then GILumenH2O.

<p>
Now, as the H2O volume in the gut decreases, the osmolarity
produced by residual fiber goes up. And if the fiber washes
out (future work) absorption, vomitus and diarrhea stop as
gut H2O volume approaches a small value near 0.

<p>
2012-10-30. Added functionality to bladder, including a request
for urine analysis followed by display of results. The XML is
located at Structure\UrineAnalysis with major edits at
Structure\Bladder. Visible at Organs | Bladder and Diagnosis |
Urine Analysis.

<p>
Bladder is now scaled and properly initialized.

<p>
2012-10-30. The cleanest way to model fasting and starvation is
to go to Lifestyle | Diet | Control, select fixed intake and set
the fixed intake value to 0. Water intake will continue. To get
complete deprivation, add a fixed water intake of 0.

<p>
2012-10-30. HumMod v2.0.36. XML in Structure\LungVeinO2 called
the wrong function in converting [O2] to pO2. Fixed. This error
was not a propagating error.

<p>
2012-10-29. Repository now displays Excel workbooks as HTML, rather
than pushing the xlsx through zoho.com.

<p>
2012-10-29. David Julian has pointed out that it is possible to
create an exercise protocol where the subject goes until he
fibrillates rather than just quitting. Also the toleraable
exercise durations were way, way too long. So there were a couple
of things wrong. Now fixed. Further details are in Structure\Exercise
Exercise-Control.REF and Exercise-Motivation.REF.

<p>
2012-10-29. HumMod 2.0.35. CO2 dissociation submodel is installed.
Relevant structures are located in Structure\CO2. The algorithm is
implemented in CO2_pCO2_To_[HCO3] and CO2_[HCO3]_To_pCO2. CO2Blood
is a wrapper for blood work.

<p>
The CO2 dissociation curve is displayed in relevant places using
the ShowMap display object. The algorithm is presented by the [i]
button. Blood work is displayed at Respiration | CO2 | Arteries

organ CO2 dissociation is visible at Organs | 'Organ Name' | CO2.

<p>
2012-10-24. HumModRepository. The 'Log' cloud button
on the home page is now smaller - indicating that it
is a more minor selection than the other selections.

<p>
2012-10-24. HumModRepository. A variety of spreadsheets
are now relevant. They are now listed and linked separately
on the 'Normal Values' home page.

<p>
Zoho is used to display the Xcel spreadsheets. A rather
complex URL is used. It begins with

<p class='Indent'>
  href='https//sheet.zoho.com/view.do?

<p>
And continues with

<p class='Indent'>
  url=http://hummod.org/autodoc/NormalValues/'Sheet Name'.xlsx'

<p>
2012-10-24. HumModRepository. Data. CO2Transport. This Web page
describes a submodel of CO2 transport in blood which will be
embedded in HumMod to get accurate values of [HCO3] as a funcion
of pCO2 and [SID]. The model is

<p class="Indent">
[HCO3] = K * (pCO2/(p50 + pCO2))
<br>
K = k' * [SID]
<br>
p50 = 32

<p>
The previous model was linear and was fit across the lungs. So, it
worked just great across the lungs for steady-state. But it worked
very poorly for venous values during exercise, when pCO2 is high and
[SID] is decreasing as a function of [Lac].

<p>
where K is a linear function of [SID]. We fit k' to the appropriate
data sets. Then during solutions, [HCO3] is calculated as a function
of the prevailing pCO2 and [SID].

<p>
2012-10-24. Repository. Reference Dot.png corrected to Dot.PNG.

<p>
2012-10-19. Version to 2.0.34 with addition of
metabolic units concept to O2 uptake. Structure is
in LungGases\MetabolicUnits (including a REF).

<p>
Variable is visible at Respiration | Gas Exchange |
O2 Uptake.

<p>
Now specifying treadmill settings in both grade (%)
and degrees. XML is in Exercise-Treadmill with
an accompanying REF.

<p>
Variable is visible at Lifestyle | Exercise |

<p>
Subject must now be standing in order to use the
treadmill.

<p>
2012-10-16. Cloned library-private to the HumMod2
working directory to access the very first edit of
v2.0.33. This is the classical circulatory description
using VascularCompartments.

<p>
2012-09-13 HumMod version bumped to 2.0.33.

<p>
Added some constants to Structure\Metabolism\
Metabolism-Tools.DES to be used in stoichiometry.

<p>
Roughed out energy dynamics for skeletal muscle
using [ATP], [PCr] and [Pi]. XML is at Structure\
SkeletalMuscle\SkeletalMuscle-Energy.DES and
Structure\RespiratoryMuscle\RespiratoryMuscle-
Energy.DES. Panels are visible at Organs |
...Muscle | Energy.

<p>
Installed a calculator to calculate hemoglobin
O2 content and saturation as a function of pO2.
Influences are temperature, pH, pCO2, CO and
[Hgb]. XML is located at Structure\Hemoglobin\
HgbCalculator. Panel is visible at Body Fluids |
Blood | Hemoglobin | Calculator.

<p>
2012-09-12 HumMod version bumped to 2.0.32.

<p>
First the problem -- as logged yesterday, HumMod
produces large amounts of lactic acid during work,
develops a fatal acidosis and fibrillates. The model
starts going anaerobic at skeletal and respiratory
pO2's of 20 Torr.

<p>
But there is some very good data available --
using MRI to monitor myogloblin desaturation --
that indicates that skeletal muscle pO2 goes
very low (3 to 5 Torr) with only moderate workload
and no anaerobic metabolism.

<p>
I've documented this in Structure\SkeletalMuscle\
SkeletalMuscle-Flow.REF.

<p>
The correction was to start anaerobic metabolism
when venous pO2 falls below 8 Torr. Note that
venous pO2 might be a couple of Torr greater than
cytosolic due to a large but still finite diffusing
capacity. Corrected curves are visible in Structures\
SkeletalMuscle\SkeletalMuscle-Flow and the comparable
RespiratoryMuscle DES file.

<p>
2012-09-11 HumMod version bumped to 2.0.31.

<p>
First, the problem -- as pointed out by David Julian
(thank you, David). When the daily planner was turned
on, HumMod would die in V-Fib at about 8:30 AM on the
first day, about 1/2 hour into exercise. The exercise
was 50W but was massively anaerobic. HumMod stops
bike and treadmill exercise when conditions become
intolerable, but work continues no-matter-what. This
allows me to shake down the model. So [Lac-] increased
to 30+ mEq/L and HumMod fibrillated as it should.

<p>
The work session was massively anaerobic because the
increase in cardiac output was inadequate. This was
puzzling because HumMod can do 50W of bike with no
trouble. BUT, HumMod is standing when doing work and is
usually recumbent when on the bike. The problem, then,
was that HumMod had accurate pooling when standing
very quietly but this pooling also continued during
muscular activity. Standing plus activity was not
accurately modeled. My bad.

<p>
Loring Rowell has gone into excellent detail in
Human Cardiovascular Control.

Pollact, A.A. and E.H.Wood. Venous pressure in the
saphenous vein at the ankle in man during exercise
and changes in posture. J.Appl.Physiol. 1:649, 1949.

<p>
There are some other references also.

<p>
Structure VenousValves replaces structure LegMusclePumping.
Structure BVSeqVeins gets some major edits. The panel in
orthostatics that shows sequestered blood volume in veins
gets considerable more detail.

<p>
Note that 2.0.31 still cannot make it through one day of
daily planner. I'll fix that tommorrow and put it in
2.0.32.

<p>
2012-09-06 A couple of pushes had incorrect version
numbers in the commit comments. Here is an accurate
list of versions for this date.

<br>
ModelSolver Build : 2012-08-10 Version : 1.0.13
<br>
InteractiveController Build : 2012-08-10 Version : 1.1.14
<br>
ScriptedController Build : 2012-09-06 Version : 2.0.9
<br>
HumMod Edit  2012-08-09 : Version : 2.0.30

<p>
Note that I have correct some previous erroneous entries
in this log.

<p>
2012-08-13 HumMod version will go to v2.0.32 or greater
with a major rewrite of the basic circulatory physiology
and applied math. More on this later.

<p>
2012-08-10 ModelSolver version bumped to v1.0.13
with some major internal revisions. Revisions are
not visible externally.

<p>
Class deletes : IPC_In_RestartSilent, S_RestartSilent.
RestartManager cleaned up.

<p>
2012-08-10 InteractiveController version bumped to
v1.1.14 with some major internal revisions. Revisions
are not visible externally.

<p>
Class deletes : IPC_Out_RestartSilent.

<p>
2012-08-09 InteractiveController bumped to
version v1.1.13. The numerical cells in tables
were not formatting. Fixed.

<p>
2012-08-09 ScriptedController bumped to version
v2.0.7. The controller gets some new elements.

<p>
skipaheadonerror - activates the skipping service.
Will skip script elements on a runtime error until
a skiptohereon error element is encountered.

<br>
skiptohereonerror - this is the marker mentioned
above.

<br>
displayruntimeerrors - the default response to a
runtime error is now to log the error details but
to not display them. Use this element to request
a display.

<p>
2012-08-09 HumModXML bumped to version 2.0.30.

<p>
Cleaned up dosing for thiazide, digoxin and
midodrine. This was done partly to make sure
that the timer variables were working correctly.

<p>
2012-08-08 ModelSolver bumped to version 1.0.12.
NormalDist variable now returns a value from a
population with the correct mean and standard
deviation.

<p>
Fixed an error in the REM binary operator (this
is the modulus operator).

<p>
Completed timer variables. Daily planner, etc.
are now working.

<p>
2012-08-08 InteractiveController version bumped
to v1.1.12. Fixed the time tool to correctly
show seconds in the panel element showclock.

<p>
2012-08-08 ScriptedController version bumped to
v2.0.8. Had a problem with variable roster and
storage when running two scripts back-to-back.
Fixed.

<p>
ScriptedController now automatically asks for a
reset after the model solver has been launched
and the model has been parsed. No need (typically)
to put a reset in your scripts. But, if you do,
the extra reset won't hurt anything.

<p>
2012-08-07 Attempting to standardize all of the save
and load IC's and solutions schema, beginning with
InteractiveController and ScriptedController.
InteractiveController version has been bumped to
v1.1.11 while ScriptedController version has been
bumped to v2.0.5.

<p>
2012-08-07 HumModXML version bumped to 2.0.29.

<p>
In the Win32 environment (HumMod.EXE), radiobuttons
must be grouped by the coder. I used the maplist
element that defines the radiobutton labels to also
define the members of the group. Lifestyle | Daily
Planner | Schedule is a panel filled with radiobuttons,
but each button knows what group it is in.

<p>
In .Net framework, all radiobuttons in a panel are
automatically grouped into a single group. Therefore,
in HumMod 2.0.28 and earlier, all of the radiobuttons
in the Schedule panel have automatically be made
members of the same group. So I gave each hour its
own group box (which is inherited from panel). It
fixes the problem and looks cool -- but is pretty
ugly in EXE.

<p>
The solver sends the controller two type of communications:
pages and messages. Pages go out at the end of a successful
integration interval, so we don't get communications 
related to failed steps. Messages go out immediately. But,
up to 1.1.10, the interactive controller did not display
the incoming message. Fixed and bumped version to 1.1.10.

<p>
2012-08-06 HumModXML version bumped to 2.0.28. Kidney
now has cortical (outer and inner) and medullary (outer
and inner) zones for mass, blood flow and sodium
reabsorption. The idea that is developing is that
EPO secretion comes predominantly from cells in the
interstitium of the proximal tubule. Thus, we need
some zone data to implement EPO dynamics. Zone XML
is located at Structure\Kidney\Kidney-Zones and zones
are visible at Organs | Kidneys | Organ | Zones.

<p>
Kidney runs metabolism off of venous pO2 now,
rather than tubular pO2. Has a new panel in Metabolism.
Visible at Organs | Kidney | Organ | Metabolism.

<p>
Merged Kidney-O2 into Kidney-Metabolism. Metabolism
panel gets a more detailed O2 view. Visible at Organs |
Kidney | Organ | Metabolism.

<p>
2012-08-04 HumModXML version bumped to 2.0.27. Kidney
get a panel tree modification because the nephron stuff
was buried too deep. Brought it up one level. Visible
at Organs | Kidney | Organ or Nephrons.

<p>
HumModXML. Kidney gets a new panel showing details of
kidney O2 physiology. Visible at Organs | Kidney.

<p>
HumModXML cleaned up the calculation and display of
EPO secretion. The XML is at Structure \ EPO \
EPOSecretion. The display is at Hormones | EPO - the
secretion box.

<p>
2012-08-04 ModelSolver version bumped to v1.0.11
after the random number generator was repaired.

<p>
The normal distribution mean has a positive bias
-- because I was summing 7 samples and dividing
by 6 to get the mean. Code is in Var_NormalDistribution.
ModelSolver\Docs\Code\Model Solver Notes - Random
Numbers has documentation and screen grabs.

<p>
2012-08-04 InteractiveController bumped to
v1.1.9 after a repair. Controller will ask
the solver for variable, integral, implicit
and curve rosters. When Advanced is click, it
makes a dialog tab for each of these rosters.
In the Strucutes list box, it selects the first
structure. But a model with no entries in one
of the four roster listed above has no first
structure to select and the controller was
throwing an exception. Now it selects the first
structure only when there is a first strucute
to select.

<p>
2012-08-04 ModelSolver version bumped to v1.0.10
after solver got two repairs.

<p>
Variable WhiteNoise had no default values
for lower and upper limits. Now default lower
limit is 0 and default upper limit is 1.

<p>
Variable NormalDist had no default values 
for mean and standard deviation. Now default
mean is 0 and default standard deviation is 1.

<p>
2012-08-04 HumModRepository. Moved the log (this
file) up to the repository's home page. Want to
improve access.

<p>
2012-08-03 TheValidator (v1.0.1). Added Variables
main menu item. This menu item evokes a tabbed
dialog that lets you browse the models variables,
integrals, implicits and curves. May be useful after
a validation study produces a runtime error.

<p>
Wrote and pushed a brief users guild. Available at
Docs\UsersGuide.

<p>
2012-08-02 ModelSolver version bumped to v1.0.9.
Repaired a small error in the message parser.

<p>
2012-08-01 Pushing a pair of simulation tools,
TheValidator and TheBatchValidator. Will push
brief user's guides later when they are available.
Both utilities use the same schema and operate on
the same XML scripts.

<p>
TheValidator is interactive. It begins with a root
script and then lets you navigate to the validation
studies that are of current interest, avoiding time
consuming studies that not of interest.

<p>
TheBatchValidator begins with a root script also
(typically the same one) and sequentially does
all of the validation work in all of the child
scripts. Results are emitted as HTML and pushed
to Web site www.hummod.org/validation.

<p>
2012-07-31 The validation repo and Web site has had
a complete makeover using a new validation tool
called TheBatchValidator (not yet pushed, coming
soon).

<p>
2012-07-31 ModelSolver. Bumped version number to
v1.0.8. Added some muscle to the implicit equation
solver and fixed an off-by-one error that I think
was producing some annoying problems.

<p>
2012-07-25 Replacing Validator and ValidationTool
with TheValidator, a more interactive and desktop
oriented validation tool.

<p>
Validator and ValidationTool have been moved to
Archives.

<p>
2012-07-22 Started Blood Chemistry | Consult. This
service scans blood chemisty values and identifies
values that are too high or too low. XML is at
Structure\BloodChemistry. Visible at Diagnosis |
Blood Chemistry | Consult.

<p>
Respiratory and skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis,
metabolism and storage is now reported in both G
and molar units.

<p>
Up to now, some aspects of exercise physiology have
only been roughed out. Now I'm adding relevant detail.

<p>
SA-Node beta receptors was recalibrated to reflect a
strong neural (vs humoral) control of heart rate.
Documentation in Structure\Heart\SANode-BetaReceptors.REF.
Visible at Circulation | Heart Rate | Atria.

<p>
Arterial pressure (particularly SBP) increases in exercise.
We can expect a SBP of 170 - 180 mmHg at 200W.

<p>
Ekblom JAP 24:518-529, 1968.

<p>
This pressure increase is the result of the central
circulation having a greater tendency to pump blood
than the skeletal muscle has a tendency to vasodilate.
I had too much metabolic vasodilation in skeletal
muscle. Cut it back. Now pressure increases.

<p>
I moved the maximum tolerable lactate concentration for
skeletal muscle up from 30 mEq/L to 40 mEq/L. This will
benefit from additional data. 

<p>
2012-07-21 HumMod bumped version to v2.0.26. The major
edit here was a redo of the Suga-Sagawa model for the
right and left hearts. Transmural pressure (TMP) in
systole now has active and passive components. The
passive component is actually the diastolic P-V
relationship. As contractilty is lost, the TMP gracefully
degrades to the remaining passive component (ie. diastole).

<p>
2012-07-19 Model Solver bumped version to v1.0.7. Added
traps for invalid power function arguments. This function
is Math.Pow in C# and ^ binary operator in DES schema.

The C# edits are in MathOperators.CS. 

<p>
2012-07-19 HumMod bumped version to v2.0.25. HumMod will
cardiac arrest with severe acidosis. The XML is located
at Structure\Acidosis\CardiacArrest. Visible at Trauma |
Acidosis.

<p>
At the panel, you can choose never, chance or always.

<p>
2012-07-18 HumMod bumped version to v2.0.24. Respiratory
muscle metabolism is now a function of alveolar ventilation.
XML is at RespiratoryMuscle-Breathing with downstream
calculations at RespiratoryMuscle-Metabolism. Visible at
Organs | Respiratory Muscle | Breathing.

<p>
2012-07-18 InteractiveController bumped version to v1.1.8.
Put menu item 'X' in the main menu. Click on X to close
the current tabbed panel.

<p>
2012-07-17 InteractiveController. The default application
behavior on a parsing or runtime error is that the
application closes down. But this behavior can be overridden
using a selection in the Advanced tabbed dialog box.

<p>
All of the graphical panel elements are now clickable,
meaning that they expose underlying model variable values
when clicked.

<ul>
<li> Graph
<li> Bargraph
<li> Map
<li> Curve
<li> ValueBar
</ul>

<p>
2012-07-17 ScriptedController bumped to v2.0.4. Added the
scripting empty element continueonerror. After this element
is encountered in a script, runtime error details are silently
logged and execution of the script continues. Way cool!

<p>
2012-07-16 HumMod (v2.0.23). Put a spritz of initial [HCO3-]
into the brain to get it to start closer to steady-state.

<p>
Completely revised the respiratory center to allow it to
see (part of) the SID in the blood. The XML is in
RespiratoryCenter-Chemical. Visible at Respiration |
Respiratory Center | Chemical Drive.

<p>
2012-07-16 HumMod (v2.0.22). This version has compartments
for all lung gases with gas going in and out following
mass balance. XML in Structure\BloodGases. Stable integrals
were required. Visible at Respiration | Blood Gases.

<p>
Model can do breath holding. XML at Structure\BreathHolding.
Visible at Lifestyle | Breath Holding.

<p>
2012-07-11 HumMod (v2.0.21). Lung volumes are implemented,
but they have no function yet. Code at Lungs\LungVolumes
and panel at Respiration | Lung Volumes.

<p>
2012-07-11 Cerebrospinal fluid panel is complete. Visible
at Organs | Cerebrospinal Fluid.

<p>
2012-07-11 Glucose TMax in kidney is now a funcion of
nephron count. Code and panel locations are in a log
entry below.

<p>
2012-07-10 HumMod (v2.0.20). Added cerebrospinal fluid as
as organ. It doesn't do anything yet but secrete and absorb,
have a pressure (still under construction ... sorry).

<p>
2012-07-10 Put in a smooth transition in renal glucose
reabsorption between total reabsorption and maximal
reabsorption. Code is in Nephrons \ NephronGlucose.
Visible at Display | Organs | Kidney | Nephrons | More |
Glucose.

<p>
2012-07-10 Increased the TMax for Na+ a bit in distal tubule
and collecting duct. Still looking for trusted data.

<p>
2012-07-10 Repaired quantitation in distal tubule. Had too
large of an effect of Na+ delivery on K+ secretion. Data
was from David Young, incidently, but I interpretted it
carelessly.

<p>
2012-07-08 HumMod (v2.0.19). Pushing now. Insulin receptors
are complete.

Benchmarks. Stop insulin secretion. Blood levels of inulin
fall to about 40% of control at 10 hours. Severe ketoacidosis
at 1 day.

I am now completely redoing control of respiration to get
CSF into the model and to get acceptable metabolic and CO2
responses.

<p>
2012-07-04 General and hepatic insulin receptors with
general, hepatic and renal insulin degradation. Note that
the liver sees portal vein insulin concentration. Receptors
are visible at Hormones | Insulin | Receptors.

<p>
Insulin clearance is the sum of net liver binding, net
general binding and renal degradation. Visible at
Hormones | Insulin | Circulating.

<p>
Insulin's organ effects are a function of fractional
binding.

<p>
2012-07-01 HumMod (v2.0.19). Fuel uses organ plasma flow in
the denominator of some ratios. It also uses values derived
from O2 use in similar denominators. So when the model is
close to or in mortis, the organ flow or O2 use stops and
we get a divide by zero. Trapped this condition in all
twelve major organs.

<p>
2012-06-30 Starting to install insulin receptors.

<p>
2012-06-30 Repaired Organs | Organ Name | Fuel panel
labels. Most said Other Tissue rather than the actual
name of the organ.

<p>
2012-06-30 HumMod XML (v2.0.18). Added pituitary gland for
future development. Now has total, anterior and posterior
mass. Visible at Organs | Pituitary Gland.

<p>
2012-06-29. HumMod XML (v2.0.17) contains some small repairs
and styling.

<p>
2012-06-28. HumMod XML (v2.0.16) allows some randomness to
be added to any of the traits: age, height, adiposity,
muscularity and other mass. This allows multiple instances
to simulate a population. Visible and controlled at Context
| Summary.

<p>
2012-06-27. Pushing SolutionBrowser (v1.0.0). There is a
brief users guide in the documentation.

<p>
2012-06-24.Trends has been recast as SolutionBrowser with
a new github repo and a new VS C# project.

<p>
2012-06-23. Made a small edit to InteractiveController and
pushed. Hold down Ctrl key on launch to get to the Advanced
dialog box without having the application attempt a full
process.
 
<p>
2012-06-21. Bumped ScriptedController version to 2.0.3. Edited
<roster> and <rosteradd> elements to give <var> element
<name> and <format> child elements. Element <format> is
optional. When not specified, values are dumped without
formatting. Details in ScriptedController | Docs | Schema
| Script.

<p>
2012-06-19. Bumped InteractiveController version to 1.1.6.
Edited save solution and load solution schema to conform
with ScriptedController (and maybe also ValidationTool and
Validator).

<p>
2012-05-27. Resuming work on trends. 

<p>
2012-05-26. Pushed Validator v2.0.4 with some small changes
in function and some small fixes. Also pushed the Validation
repo with current Validator output.

<p>
2012-05-25. v2.0.2 changes the layout of a scripts results
file to
<br># Header
<br># Scores
<br># All of the rest in chronological order

<p>
2012-05-25. My bad. v2.0.0 did not have full change function.
Fixed and pushed v2.0.1.

<p>
2012-05-25. Validator (v2.0) has been pushed and is ready
for evaluation.

<p>
2012-05-23. Just an update here. Still working on the
Validator(v2.0). The basic stuff is great. Adding some
features.

<p>
2012-05-19. Totally rebuilding the Validator. Will bump
the version number to 2.

<p>
2012-05-18. Finished ValidationTool. Pushed version 1.0.0.
A sample script is located in Docs | Scripts.

<p>
2012-05-16. ValidationTool(v0.2.0). It parses, runs the
solver, shows Advanced. It parses test but doesn't calculate
the results, yet.

<p>
2012-05-16. Add general scripting schema documentation for
the ValadationTool and the Validator. In Docs | Schema |
Script | ... - OverviewScript.DOCX.

<p>
2012-05-15. Added folders, HTML and PNG's to the basic
validation Web site.

<p>
2012-05-13. Validation stuff now has its own repository
in github, named 'validation'. Like 'autodoc', this
repository is a Web site. You get their from the HumMod
Repository using the link 'http://hummod.github.com/validation.

<p>
The root file is the default 'index.html'.

<p>
Each model in the HumMod Repository can have its own
validation content. Right now, only HumMod(v2.0) has validation
content. You get to this content via Home | Models |
HumMod (v2.0) and the Validation button.

<p>
2012-05-11. Adding classes to ValidationTool. Still not
functional. But gaining,

<p>
2012-05-11. Creating a validation tool that is used
in building and testing validation scripts. Called
ValidationTool.EXE. This tool does not emit HTML and
does not interact with the Internet. Instead, it parses
validation scripts and displays or emits the test scores.
When a script or scripts are judged to be useful, they
can then be folded into a larger group or scripts that
are used in the global validation study. ValidationTool
runs locally in any location. I pushed a shell copy of
the code.

<p>
2012-05-10. Removed lots of dead code from
ScriptedController.

<p>
2012-05-09.  Revised pipe sequences in these four
applications. Files edited were IPC_InBox.CS and
IPC_OutBox.CS. In addition, tweaked MainWindow.CS in
ModelSolver. Pushed all four.

<p>
InteractiveController (1.1.5)
<br>
ScriptedController (2.0.1)
<br>
ModelSolver (1.0.6)
<br>
Validator (1.1.3)

<p>
2012-05-09. Pushed Scripted Controller (Version 2.0.0).
It has been lightly tested. Needs rigorous testing.

<p>
2012-05-01. The repository called HumModRepository on
my local workstation was pushed to github to become a
Web site biosim.github.com (www. is no loanger required).
Then we moved the host to hummod.github.com/autodoc.
This document is hosted in the repository be moved. So
if there is no further traffic on this topic, all of the
stuff at biosim.github.com will be presented at
hummod.github.com/autodoc.

<p>
2012-03-09. The next step is a total renovation of
the way context scales initial values.  

<p>
2012-03-09. HumMod's folder organization so far has
been to keep context stuff in a separate folder up
at the level of sturcture, control and display. But
really, context stuff is all structure -- so I made
it a subfolder under Structure. Deleted benchmarks.
Bumped version number to 2.0.15.

<p>
2012-03-09. Two script names (presumably primary and
sandbox) can now be specified and toggled. Visible at
Advanced | Startup. Version to 1.1.2. 

<p>
2012-03-09. Validator wants to run a predetermined script
at startup using information stored in the registry. But
if you don't want this, hold down the control key when
launching.

<p>
2012-03-09. The InteractiveController would not update an
open panel after the user did something on another panel
and then came to the former. Fixed. Bumped version to 1.1.4.

<p>
2012-03-07. Stripped all of the dead code out of Validator
and started routine use. There is no documentation but
there are plenty of scripts in the repository. v1.1.1.

<p>
2012-03-07. Totally rewrote Validator to simplify schema,
increase flexibility and improve internal structure.
Bumped version number to 1.1.0.

<p>
2012-03-06. Bumped version number to 1.0.2. Edited a type in
tabbed dialog Status.

<p>
2012-03-05. Working on some improvements to Validator. Bump
version number to 1.0.1.

<p>
2012-03-04. Validator is a simulation utility that parses and
executes scripts that control solutions. Validator collects
measures of prediction accuracy and emits this information as
Web pages in the HumMod Repository. Version 1.0.0 has just
been pushed.

<p>
Sub-folder organization is significant. Each sub-folder contains
one script named Script.Script. Validator takes this script and
emits an HTML version of it. Validator then executes the script
and emits the results as HTML into Results.HTML in the same
subfolder.

<p>
So after Validator has been run, each sub-folder contains three
files.

<p> # Script.Script (by the scipt author)
<br> # Script.HTML (by Validator)
<br> # Results.HTML (by Validator)

<p>
Some early results can be seen in the HumMod Repository
under Validation.

<p>
The Validator bottom line is that Validator takes care of all
of the Web site management. The script writer can focus solely
on creating scripts that accurately evaluate the performance
of the model.

<p>
2012-02-27. Changed the Settings menu item in the ModelSolver
to Advanced and added some tabs. Making some small changes in
ScriptedController as it is used to do validation. Added more
tabs to advanced.

<p>
2012-02-27. Refactored the pipe in both controllers and the
solver. Then bumped version numbers.

<p> Interactive Controller (v1.1.3)
<br> Scripted Controller (v1.1.6)
<br> Model Solver (v1.0.5)

<p>
2012-02-26. Added elements to the ScriptedController's scripting
schema to help accumlating, formatting and pasting to the results
log statistics generated by the Accept, Quality and Review tests.
The element names start with stats_. Documentation is in Docs at
ScriptedController\Docs\Schema\Script.

<p>
2012-02-26. Added script_to_html element to ScriptedController's
schema. This element tells the ScriptedController to take all of
the files contributing to the current script and make HTML
formatted copies of the files. Way cool, these copies can be
routed directly and automatically to the HumMod repository Web
site. A site visitor can see both the results of a script and
the script that created the results. Repository curator (currently)
must manually edit an index page for each of results and scripts.

<p>
2012-02-26. Bumped InteractiveController version to 1.1.5 with a
large number of edits underway.

<p>
2012-02-25. Completed implementing the scripted controller's
files element.

<p>
2012-02-25. Added some new elements to the scripted controller's
scripting schema so that statistics may be calculated, accumulated
and displayed on a local, regional or global basis. Will have
some documentation next.

<p>
2012-02-25. Bumped version numbers due to a variety of edits.

<p> Interactive Controller (v1.1.2)
<br> Scripted Controller (v1.1.4)
<br> Model Solver (v1.0.4)

<p>
2012-02-25. I modified the pipe a bit to tidy it up. I hope
that I didn't foul it up.

<p>
2012-02-24. Small edits to scripted controller.

<p>
2012-02-24. Interactive controller goes to v1.1.1 with better
implementation of the action button. Build date is now shown
in the dialog box. Model title now comes across from the model
solver in the large controllerinfo message. The title is then
added to controller's title bar (at the top of the main window).

<p>
2012-02-24. Model solver now treats action button as a top-level
asynchronous event. Responds with two new messages : actionbuttondone
and actionbuttonfailed. Version 1.0.3.

<p>
2012-02-23. All of the basic formatting code is in place in
ScriptedController and it is ready for use. But a large
amount of further refinement is forthcoming

<p>
2012-02-23. Fixed ActionButton problem. The problem was in
the ModelSolver which thought that an action button message
was actually an action button display element. Thanks Drew.

<p>
2012-02-23. Bumped version to v1.1.3. Refactored file I/O. 

<p>
2012-02-22. ScriptedController edits are moving right along.

<p>
2012-02-22. Bumped ScriptedController to v1.1.2 as edits continue.

<p>
2012-02-22. Expanded the HumModRepository to store and display the
scripts used in model validation.

<p>
2012-02-21. Well into final part of this redo, which is implementing
the emit element. Emit lets a script specify the results log
formatting as: TEXT, XML, or HTML.

<p>
2012-02-21. Cleaned up code that handles a missing startup script
(named in command line or registry).

<p>
2012-02-21. Bumped ScriptedController to v1.1.1 as edits continue.

<p>
2012-02-20. There may have been a long standing error in getting
startup script names out of the registry. Startup code has been
refactored. Looks and works good.

<p>
2012-02-20. New scripting elements have been added to schema and
to code. Documentation is up to date in Docs | Schema | Script. 

<p>
2012-02-20. Bumped ScriptedController to v1.1.0. A major remake
is underway.

<p>
2012-02-20. Added three elements to the Scripted Controller's
scripting schema (no coding yet, just documentation). These
elements should be useful when we are routing Scripted
Controller output directly to a Web site.

<p>
The new elements are

<p>&lt;parent&gt; ... &lt;/parent&gt;
<br>&lt;homepath&gt; ... &lt;/homepath&gt;
<br>&lt;breadcrumbs&gt; ... &lt;/breadcrumbs&gt;

<p>
2012-02-20. Roughed out the model validation section in
the HumMod Repository. Try Validation | HumMod(v2.0) |
Initial Values ... 

<p>
2012-02-19. Following Marek's suggestion, renal efferent
blood flow was broken down into some of its component
parts. Details are visible at Organs | Kidney | Vascular
Segments | Efferent Artery. 

<p>
2012-02-19. Added vascular conductance on a /G basis to :
right heart, left heart, hepatic artery, hepatic vein,
kidney.

<p>
2012-02-19. Bumped version to 2.0.13.

<p>
2012-02-18. Putting in all vascular conductance as a /G
function of organ weight (ie scaled). About 1/2 done.

<p>
2012-02-18. I didn't have lactate metabolism quite right,
and after two weeks the lactate mass in the kidney went to
zero triggering a divide by zero in the fuel selector. I
think that this is fixed with improved physiology actually.

<p>
2012-02-18. Bumped version to 2.0.12.

<p>
2012-02-17. Marek pointed out that I was cutting corners on
this calculation by assuming a pulse pressure in the stroke
volume calculation (using the Suga-Sagawa heart model). The
rigorous calculation is now in place, using an implicit
algebraic equation. SBP in aorta and pulmonary artery is
defined by the implicit. Stoke volume is calculated and used
to calculate the end value of SBP. The calculation crosses
several structures, but it should be a very benign calculation.

<p>
2012-02-17. Values for left and right side stenosis and regurg
are now in groupboxes in the left and right heart pumping
panels.

<p>
2012-02-17. Code and panels are now installed in all 12 major
organs for the new fuel selector.

<p>
2012-02-16. Starting a data section in HumMod repository for
dietary sodium intake. Will use this data later for model
validation.

<p>
2012-02-15. Modified the Model Solver so that it can return
the model's title when requested. The Scripted Controller can
use this information when doing validations. The incoming
message is &lt;requesttitle/&gt; and the outgoing message is
&lt;title&gt; Title &lt;/title&gt;.

<p>
The title contains the model's version number.

<p>
Bumped the Model Solver's version number to 1.0.1.

<p>
2012-02-14. I created a new, way cool fuel selector. It is
initially installed in other tissues.

<p>
2012-02-14. There is now water vapor in inspired air. The
calculation is based on relative humidity. There is also a
water vapor gas tank. Air is humidified in the bronchi
(added groupbox) and insensible loss is calculated using
the amount of H2O added. This advance was suggested by
Drew. 

<p>
2012-02-14. Bumped version to 2.0.11.

<p>
2012-02-13. The big increase in arterial pO2 at the start of
exercise is gone, probably because cardiac output is increasing
more accurately.

<p>
2012-02-13. CO2 balance is now calculated in detail, including
renal bicarb excretion (suggested by Marek). Results are
displayed in a panel at Respiration | CO2 | Balance.

<p>
2012-02-13. Hunger is now a function of [Glucose] and
[Leptin].

<p>
2012-02-13. Redid mass balance and thermodynamics in GI
lumen.

<p>
2012-02-13. Bumped version to 2.0.10.

<p>
2012-02-12. Expanded the Lifestyle menu Diet to include
Hunger | Thirst and Control. Temperature of ingested food
and water may now be specified.

<p>
2012-02-12. Bumped version number to 2.0.9.

<p>
2012-02-11. Replaced the numerical methods in the pulmonary
circulation with a better way to do the hemodynbamics. I like
the results.

<p>
2012-02-11. Rescaled initial plasma protein to get an initial
COP of 28 mmHg. COP was starting at 26, which caused some
plasma leak into the IFV. Then scaled interstitial protein
for the first time to get an initial COP of around 8 mmHg.

<p>
2012-02-11.Added an Energy section, with Energy-Stores and
Energy-Tools structures. The first idea here is to calculated
and display total energy stored in the body, including lipid
and glycogen. Panel is visible as Energy Stores on the
Metabolism menu.

<p>
2012-02-11. Bumped version to 2.0.8.

<p>
2012-02-10. VascularCompartments keep their name in structures,
but are displayed under Circulation as Blood Vessels. Then in
the Blood Vessels menu, there is a Great Veins menu selection.
It shows panels for Superior Vena Cava, Coronary Sinus and
Inferior Vena cava.

<p>
2012-02-10. Revised Circulation | OrganFlow to prepare for
a superior and inferior vena cava. Right and left hearts now
drain into the right atrium through the coronary sinus, as
recommended by Marek.

<p>
2012-02-10. Bumped version to 2.0.7.

<p>
2012-02-09. Fixed middle and lower torso water problem as
reported by both Marek and Radu.

<p>
2012-02-09. Add lots of new pages to the Normal Values Web
site.

<p>
2012-02-08.Adding spreadsheet sheets and Web pages to Normal
Values in HumModRepository. 

<p>
2012-02-08. Cleaned up the layout in respiratory muscle size.
There was groupbox overlap.

<p>
2012-02-06. The idea right now is to put a lot of function
into a spreadsheet so that model scaling becomes algorithmic.
So far, so good. Added the basic building blocks like organ
mass and organ blood flow. The tougher stuff will come
later.

<p>
2012-02-05. Redesigned the Normal Values section of the
HumModRepository and started adding pages.

<br> General - Organ Mass
<br> General - Gender
<br> General - Blood Pressures
<br> General - Blood Flow

<p>
2012-02-04. Added major new section to HumModRepository titled
Normal Values with subsections Male 37 Years and Female 37 Years.

<p>
2012-02-04. Bumped version number to 2.0.6.

<p>
2012-02-03. Increased the initial CO2 mass in the brain a little
to get a better starting brain pH.

<p>
2012-02-03. Changed the name of BloodPh structure to BloodPhValues. 

<p>
2012-02-03. Add groupbox that announces gender at gender specific
organs : ovaries, uterus, testes. 

<p>
2012-02-03. Removed stimulators menu item and panel from Intervention.
Model had a couple of neural stimulators but I'm switching to clamps
to have consistency across the model.

<p>
2012-02-03. In menus and panels, RHPumping goes to RightHeartPumping,
LHPumping goes to LeftHeartPumping and Contractility goes to
HeartStrength. Left Heart and Right Heart Heart Strength, Contractile
Protein and Work get group boxes  -- in one case to separate
radiobuttons and in all cases to improve the look.

<p>
2012-02-03. Arterial hemorrhage can now be fixed rate or pressure
driven. Panel is under Trauma.

<p>
2012-02-03. Bumped version number to 2.0.5.


<p>
2012-02-02. Modeled coronary sinus. Variables are 

<p>
2012-02-02. Added posture energy. The code is in PostureEnergy.
The panel is under Miscellaneous | Orthostasis.

<p>
2012-02-02. Added heart mechanoreceptors code and panels at
autonomics afferents and autonomics CNS. Tidied up vagus nerve.

<p>
2012-02-02. Bumped version number to 2.0.4.

<p>
2012-02-01. Removed SequesteredBV from the Nerves | Autonomics |
Efferents menu. Installed Alpha Receptors menu item at Miscellaneous 
Orthostatics | Sequestered Blood. Added a panel. Edited sequestered
blood in arteries and veins to show effect of alpha agonist on
pressure-volume relationship.

<p>
2012-02-01. Renamed the SympsChemo structure to ChemoreceptorsCNS.
Then wrote the code and panel for the CNS processing of
chemoreceptor afferent nerve activity.

<p>
2012-02-01. Added code and panel for Cushing response.

<p>
2012-02-01. Added code and panel for CNS trophic factor.

<p>
2012-02-01. Bumped version number to 2.0.3.

<p>
2012-01-31. Edited code, added panels and boxes for afferent
autonomic nerves and central integration of the metaboreflex.
Also fleshed out its effect on the respiratory center.

<p>
Completing and redoing chemoreceptors.

<p>
2012-01-31. Bumped version number to 2.0.2.

<p>
2012-01-30. Added a data set to the HumModRepository. It
is visible at Data | Acid-Base | Ketoacidosis.

<p>
2012-01-29. Two structures were added under Structures \
Morphology. They are Volume.DES and Density.DES. These
structures calculate the volume and the density of the
body.

<p>
Then Display\Diagnosis was edited to replace Morphology
menu item with a Size menu. The Size panels show morphology,
body mass, body volume and body density in detail.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added group boxes and tidied up panels for

<p class='Indent'>
Display\Hormones\CRF\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Cortisol\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\PTH\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Vitamin D\... 4 Panels.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added tissue details to Pancreas. Details are
visible in Organs | More | Pancreas.

<p>
2012-01-29. Added tissue details to Adrenal Gland. Details are
visible in Organs | More | Adrenal Gland.

<p>
2012-01-29. Bumped HumMod XML version number to 2.0.1. Plan to
bump daily now with all of the edits going in.

<p>
2012-01-28. With the Win32 library (HumMod.EXE), the programmer
must group the radiobuttons into functional groups. With C# and
WinForms, all of the radiobuttons with the same parent are
considered to be in the same group. I had some panels with more
than one group of radiobuttons on the surface. Parenthood was
clarified by putting groups of buttons in appropriate group
boxes. Panels that were edited :

<p class='Indent'>
Display\Hormones\ACTH\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Calcitonin\...

<br>
Display\Hormones\Cortisol\...

<p>
More panel edits to follow.

<p>
2012-01-28. Installed placeholder folders and files for adrenal
gland and pancreas. Organ weights are visible at <i>Organs</i>
| <i>More</i>. Folders and files created :

<p class='Indent'>

<p>
2012-01-28. Thanks to Drew Pruett for this fix. And also Marek. Renin
flux between free renin and granules had derivative signs reversed,
which violated conservation of mass and caused big problems in many
simulations after time had advanced about a week. Files edited :

<p>
2012-01-27. To get solution control and display information from
the model solver, the model controller sends a <i>requestcontrollerinfo/</i>
empty message. The controller has a response that was prepared during
model parsing and replies with a <i>controllerinfo</i> ...
<i>/controllerinfo</i> message wrapped around the info.

<p>
2012-01-27. You can edit the content for the <i>hidewindow</i>
element below to <i>True</i> to hide the model solver's main
window. Generally, Windows won't let you hide an application's
main window, but you can minimize and not show it in the task
bar to make it completely disappear.

<p class='Indent'>
WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized ;

<br>
ShowInTaskbar = false ;

<p>
If there is a messup, use the task manager to mop up. Note that the
only way to get the window back is to edit the INI file back to
<i>False</i>.

<p>
2012-01-27. The model solver uses an INI file in place of Windows
registry.

<code>
<P>&lt;ini&gt;
  <p class='Indent'> &lt;windowtop&gt; 136 &lt;/windowtop&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowleft&gt; 776 &lt;/windowleft&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowhigh&gt; 174 &lt;/windowhigh&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowwide&gt; 341 &lt;/windowwide&gt;
  <br> &lt;windowstate&gt; 0 &lt;/windowstate&gt;
  <br> &lt;pipeinterval&gt; 200 &lt;/pipeinterval&gt;
  <br> &lt;hidewindow&gt; False &lt;/hidewindow&gt;
<p>&lt;/ini&gt;
</code>

<p>
2012-01-27. Model controllers launch the model solver and pass the model
name and location in using the command line. On the desktop it might be
possible to use the defaults by putting the model controller, model
solver and model root file all in the same folder.

<p>
But a better idea might be to specify the model solver and model using
the model controller's <i>Advanced</i> menu selection.

<p>
<img src='DialogShowingSolverAndModel.PNG'>

<p>
The defaults are

<p class='Indent'>
Solver : Model Solver.exe

<br>
Model : HumMod.DES

<p>
2012-01-27. The Model Solver now parses the entire model and tucks
information that might be needed by the model controller into a cache.

<p>
2012-01-27. The development and use of Builder and BuilderXML has been
discontinued. Repository content has been moved to the Archives repo and
the Builder and BuilderXML repo's have been deleted.

<p>
2012-01-26. I created separate documentation sections in HumModRepository
for HumMod(1_6) release and HumMod(2_0) being developed.

<br>
<img src='ReleaseVersions.PNG'>

<p>
2012-01-19. Created this log to record the edits applied to HumMod's XML
files. T.C.
